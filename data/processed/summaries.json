(Super. Ct. No. SCD301504)\n\n MARKUS EICHHORST,\n\n           Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County,\nJoan P. Weber, Judge. Affirmed.\n         Lisa A. Kopelman, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for\nDefendant and Appellant.\n         No appearance by Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\f      Following a jury trial, Markus Eichhorst was convicted of vandalism\n\ncausing more than $400 in damages. (Pen. Code,1 \u00a7 594, subds. (a) & (b)(1);\ncount 3.) The jury was unable to reach a verdict on counts 1 and 2\u2014charges\nof child abuse (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a); count 1) and assault with force likely to\nproduce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4); count 2)\u2014and the trial court\ndeclared a mistrial as to each count. Eichhorst subsequently pleaded guilty\nto count 2 in exchange for dismissal of count 1. The court sentenced him to\ntwo years formal probation with conditions that included 180 days in county\njail and payment of direct restitution, along with other fines and fees.\n      Eichhorst filed a timely notice of appeal. Appellate counsel asks this\ncourt to conduct an independent review of the record for reversible error\nunder People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436. We offered Eichhorst the\nopportunity to file his own brief on appeal, but he did not respond.\n             FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      The charges against Eichhorst arose out of what can be colloquially\nreferred to as a \u201croad rage\u201d incident. To provide context for the charges at\ntrial, the jury heard evidence that, following several miles of erratic driving,\nEichhorst intentionally collided with another vehicle. Inside the other\nvehicle were Lance Tamyo and his 12-year-old son (the victim). After the\naccident, both vehicles pulled over and Tamyo called 911.\n      While waiting for the police to arrive, Eichhorst approached Tamyo\u2019s\nvehicle twice. He first went to confront Tamyo and became angry when\nTamyo blamed him for the collision. When he returned to Tamyo\u2019s vehicle a\nsecond time, Eichhorst tried to open the front passenger-side door, where the\nvictim was sitting, while shouting and hitting the car with metal pliers. He\neventually broke through the glass window and punched the victim before\n\n\n1     Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n                                        2\n\freaching into the car to grab him. Once the victim fled to the backseat,\nEichhorst attempted to open the rear passenger-side door and continued\nhitting the vehicle with the pliers until he heard sirens approaching.\n      Police arrived and detained Eichhorst. A police officer testified there\nwas blood on both the broken car window and Eichhorst\u2019s hands.\n                                DISCUSSION\n      Appellate counsel filed a Wende brief, requesting the court\nindependently review the record for error. In line with Anders v. California\n(1967) 386 U.S. 738, counsel identified a potentially arguable issue to assist\nwith our review: Whether the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the\njury with CALCRIM No. 3404.\n      The identified issue does not rise to the level of arguable issues for\nreversal on appeal because the request for, and denial of, CALCRIM No. 3404\ndid not concern the vandalism charge\u2014the only charge of which the jury\nconvicted Eichhorst.\n      We have independently reviewed the entire record as mandated by\nWende and Anders and found no arguable issues. Competent counsel has\nrepresented Eichhorst on this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f                            DISPOSITION\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                          DATO, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nO\u2019ROURKE, Acting P.

    "summary": "Here is a summary of the case in 3-5 sentences using simple language:\n\nMarkus Eichhorst was convicted of vandalism after a \"road rage\" incident where he intentionally collided with another vehicle, causing over $400 in damages. He also tried to open the door of the other vehicle and punched the 12-year-old passenger while shouting and hitting the car with metal pliers. The key legal issue is whether there was reversible error during the trial. The outcome is that Eichhorst was sentenced to two years of formal probation, 180 days in county jail, and payment of restitution and fines."

A second procedure followed\n\nin August 2016. After some difficulty eating and speaking, a different doctor\n\ndiagnosed Belisle with nerve damage. She sued Proliance Surgeons, Inc.,\n\nDr. Seely, and several others in April 2020. Several parties were dismissed on\n\nsummary judgment and the case proceeded to trial in November 2023. The jury\n\nreturned a defense verdict.\n\n       Belisle appeals, asserting that the trial court improperly dismissed claims\n\nagainst Dr. Roger Zundel on summary judgment; improperly denied Belisle\u2019s\n\nmotion to shorten time; erred in limiting Belisle\u2019s testimony about her medical\n\nconditions, erred in allowing late-disclosed expert testimony, and erred in\n\nexcluding Dr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis. Belisle also contends that\n\nthe evidence is insufficient to support the jury verdict. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n                                     Background\n\n       In April 2016, Stephanie Belisle sought care from otolaryngologist\n\nDr. Daniel Seely for a recurring tonsil infection. After taking a patient history and\n\nperforming a physical exam, Dr. Seely determined that she was a candidate for a\n\ntonsillectomy with a possible adenoidectomy. Dr. Seely documented discussing\n\nthe nature of this surgery with Belisle, including its risks, benefits, and\n\n\n                                           2\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/3\n\n\nalternatives. Belisle chose to proceed with the surgery.\n\n       The day of the surgery, the medical team provided Belisle with a series of\n\ndocuments including an informed consent form. The informed consent form\n\nlisted nerve injury as a possible risk. Belisle signed the informed consent form\n\nand Dr. Seely performed the procedure.\n\n                                Postoperative Care\n\n       Belisle\u2019s first postoperative appointment took place with Lori Hill, a\n\ncertified physician\u2019s assistant, about two weeks after the procedure. Belisle\n\ndescribed a difficult recovery because she took very little pain medication and\n\nwas having difficulty swallowing. She did note feeling significantly improved\n\notherwise. Hill informed Belisle that she was slightly behind in recovery because\n\nDr. Seely had to \u201cgo deeper\u201d than normal to remove the tissue but that she\n\nshould continue to improve.\n\n       Belisle saw Dr. Seely for her second postoperative visit, expressing\n\ngreater difficulty swallowing and a feeling of \u201ccatching\u201d on the right side of her\n\nthroat. Dr. Seely performed a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, 1 which was\n\nunremarkable. He recommended a barium swallow study and speech pathology\n\nevaluation.\n\n       Belisle returned to Dr. Seely in June with continuing symptoms. Dr. Seely\n\nprescribed antibiotics and scheduled the barium swallow study. He also noted\n\n\n\n\n       1A flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy involves passing a small, flexible\ncamera through the nose and into the throat to view the larynx.\n\n                                          3\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/4\n\n\nthat \u201cif [Belisle] remain[ed] severely symptomatic, return to the operating room for\n\ndirect inspection of the tonsillar fossa may be considered.\u201d\n\n       In early July, Belisle saw Dr. Seely\u2019s colleague, Dr. Roger Zundel, while\n\nDr. Seely was out of town. She described severe difficulty swallowing and\n\nreported that she was completely unable to eat solid food. Dr. Zundel\u2019s physical\n\nexam was normal. Belisle saw Dr. Zundel a second time two weeks later, again\n\nreporting persistent gagging. Dr. Zundel expressed that he \u201cd[id] not have a solid\n\nexplanation\u201d for Belisle\u2019s experience. He recommended an esophagoscopy with\n\na biopsy but documented the need to discuss with Dr. Seely.\n\n                                  Second Surgery\n\n       Belisle underwent the esophagoscopy with biopsy when Dr. Seely\n\nreturned in August 2016. Before the procedure, the medical team again provided\n\nBelisle with an informed consent form. The form described the planned\n\nprocedure as a \u201cmicro direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, esophagoscopy\u201d to\n\nevaluate Belisle\u2019s difficulty swallowing. By signing the form, Belisle\n\nacknowledged that \u201cduring the course of the operation . . . unforeseen conditions\n\nmay necessitate additional or different procedures than those above set forth\u201d\n\nand authorized the performance of such procedures. She also acknowledged\n\nthat she had been informed of risks and complications, including nerve injury.\n\n       The consent form authorized Dr. Zundel, \u201cand/or such associates or\n\nassistants, including, if applicable, other physicians who will have an active\n\nprocess in the surgery\u201d to perform the procedure. Dr. Seely performed the\n\nprocedure and Dr. Zundel was not otherwise involved.\n\n\n                                         4\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/5\n\n\n       While performing the micro-laryngoscopy and esophagoscopy, Dr. Seely\n\nsaw a \u201ctiny amount of residual lymphoid tissue\u201d and performed a biopsy to\n\nremove it. Belisle\u2019s discomfort and difficulty swallowing continued after the\n\nsecond surgery.\n\n                                Additional Opinions\n\n       Following the second surgery, Belisle sought a number of additional\n\nopinions to determine the cause of her pain and dysphagia. Over the course of\n\nseveral months and with input from a variety of physicians and speech\n\npathologists, Belisle determined that she suffers from a hypercontractile\n\nesophagus. Also known as a \u201cjackhammer\u201d esophagus, the condition makes it\n\nextremely difficult to swallow. Belisle believed the condition to be the result of\n\nnerve damage from her adenotonsillectomy.\n\n                                     Initial Suit\n\n       In April 2020, Belisle sued 16 defendants, including Proliance Surgeons,\n\nInc. (Proliance), Dr. Seely, and Dr. Zundel, for alleged medical malpractice while\n\nperforming her tonsil surgeries. In addition to general negligence, Belisle\n\nasserted that Dr. Seely and Dr. Zundel failed to obtain informed consent for\n\neither procedure. Belisle also named nine other defendants, and their spouses\n\nand marital communities, who had never been involved in Belisle\u2019s care.\n\n       Belisle deposed Dr. Seely shortly after initiating the lawsuit. When asked\n\nwhen he retired, Dr. Seely informed Belisle that he \u201cwent out on medical leave\u201d in\n\nMay 2018. Belisle did not ask any further questions about that medical leave\n\nduring the deposition or any time thereafter.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/6\n\n\n       Dr. Seely also repeatedly defended his medical care, testifying that he\n\nperformed each procedure correctly and did not cut deeply enough to cause\n\nnerve injury as claimed. Dr. Seely cited his own experience performing the\n\nsurgery, as well as the pathology report confirming that he removed only tonsillar\n\ntissue with no additional muscle or nerve tissue, in support of his testimony.\n\nBelisle did not ask Dr. Seely about his informed consent procedures or pre-\n\nsurgery discussions. Belisle did not depose Dr. Zundel.\n\n                          Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n       Proliance first moved for summary judgment dismissal in December 2020.\n\nBringing three claims, Proliance asserted that Belisle failed to produce the\n\nnecessary expert testimony to sustain a medical malpractice claim, that Belisle\u2019s\n\nhusband\u2019s derivative loss of marital consortium claim failed as a result, and that\n\nBelisle did not allege facts that could give rise to any action against the nine\n\nlisted defendants who were not involved in her care.\n\n       Proliance voluntarily withdrew the expert testimony claim in January but\n\ncontinued forward with the other two claims. The trial court denied the motion as\n\nto the loss of marital consortium but granted summary judgment dismissing the\n\nindividual claims against the nine other doctors at Proliance, their spouses, and\n\nmarital communities.\n\n       After setting a trial date and working out the details of in-person versus\n\nZoom attendance, Proliance moved for summary judgment a second time in\n\nJune 2023. Proliance contended that Belisle lacked sufficient evidence to\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/7\n\n\nestablish a prima facie case for medical negligence, loss of consortium, or failure\n\nto secure informed consent.\n\n       Opposing summary judgment, Belisle produced declarations from\n\nDr. Michael Kaplan and Dr. Matt Hershcovitch, both otolaryngologists, criticizing\n\nDr. Seely and Dr. Zundel\u2019s informed consent process. At argument on the issue,\n\nthe court acknowledged that it was difficult to piece together Belisle\u2019s evidence\n\nagainst Dr. Zundel but denied the entirety of the motion for summary judgment.\n\n       Dr. Zundel moved for reconsideration on the issue of informed consent\n\nbecause, as he did not perform the procedure at issue, he believed he had no\n\nlegal duty to obtain informed consent. Belisle responded that because\n\nDr. Zundel was \u201cin the same practice\u201d as Dr. Seely, handled the informed\n\nconsent forms, and appeared on the consent forms, Dr. Zundel was liable for any\n\ninjuries associated with the second procedure. The trial court disagreed and\n\ngranted Dr. Zundel\u2019s motion for reconsideration, dismissing the informed consent\n\nclaims against him.\n\n       In September 2023, Belisle moved for summary judgment. Belisle argued\n\nthat no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of her medical bills. But she included no legal authority, analysis, or\n\nargument as to why she was entitled to a dispositive ruling on the issue. Five\n\ndays later, Belisle moved to shorten time on her motion for summary judgment,\n\nacknowledging that the motion when filed fell outside the court\u2019s case schedule\n\norder deadline for dispositive motions. She argued that, as the medical bills were\n\nuncontested, shortening time was appropriate. Dr. Seely opposed Belisle\u2019s\n\n\n                                         7\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/8\n\n\nmotion to shorten time, clarifying that he did in fact contest medical causation\n\nand that causation is central to the reasonableness of medical care and\n\nnecessity of any resulting medical bills.\n\n       The trial court denied Belisle\u2019s motion to shorten time, finding that she\n\nprovided no legal authority, argument, or explanation as to why she could not\n\nhave filed the summary judgment motion within the deadline. The trial court did\n\nnot rule on her motion for summary judgment, leaving the question of whether\n\nthe medical bills would be admitted to be determined at trial.\n\n                              Other Pre-Trial Motions\n\n       In the days leading up to trial, the court heard argument on the remaining\n\npre-trial motions that had not been addressed by either motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       Informing the court that Dr. Seely had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s\n\ndisease in 2018, Proliance requested accommodations for medicine and rest\n\nbreaks. Proliance also requested that the court instruct the jury about his\n\ncondition so that they would not speculate about Dr. Seely\u2019s visible tremor.\n\nBelisle initially agreed with Proliance\u2019s request. After a recess, however, Belisle\n\nstated that \u201c[plaintiff\u2019s counsel] just found out about [the diagnosis]\u201d and claimed\n\nthat Dr. Seely\u2019s disease must have existed at the time of Belisle\u2019s procedure.\n\nInstead of having the court simply inform the jury of Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis, Belisle\n\nindicated that she intended to argue it resulted in her injury. Belisle\n\nacknowledged that she did not have an expert to testify about the progression of\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease or any evidence that Dr. Seely\u2019s eventual diagnosis\n\n\n                                            8\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/9\n\n\nimpacted either surgery. Given that lack of evidence, and the risk of leading the\n\njury to speculate, the court excluded any testimony or argument that Dr. Seely\u2019s\n\ndiagnosis was implicated in the alleged malpractice.\n\n       Proliance also moved in limine asking the trial court to preclude Belisle\n\nfrom testifying about her mental and emotional pain and suffering. The trial court\n\ndenied the motion but reserved ruling on a similar motion in limine to exclude\n\nnon-physician testimony on medical facts, standards of care, or causation. The\n\ncourt determined that Belisle, a former trauma nurse, may have been able to\n\ntestify to some medical facts, and therefore, defense counsel needed to object at\n\nthe time of questioning.\n\n       The trial court then addressed Belisle\u2019s request to admit the medical bills\n\nat issue as a group, requiring Belisle to submit each bill as an individual exhibit.\n\n                                        Trial\n\n       The case proceeded to trial in November 2023. Belisle testified over the\n\ncourse of multiple days about her medical history, diagnoses and treatment\n\noptions, and remaining symptoms. The court only limited Belisle\u2019s medical\n\ntestimony on hearsay or foundational objections.\n\n       Dr. Seely testified in defense of his medical care and informed consent\n\nprocess. He unequivocally denied cutting deep enough to injure Belisle\u2019s nerves\n\nand stated that he complied with the standard of care. Both parties presented\n\ntestimony from multiple experts.\n\n       Belisle\u2019s otolaryngologist experts testified that they believed Dr. Seely cut\n\ntoo deep and injured Belisle\u2019s vagus nerve. Neither described how the nerve\n\n\n                                          9\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/10\n\n\ninjury could have occurred, nor did they assert Dr. Seely breached the standard\n\nof care during the second procedure.\n\n          Dr. Seely\u2019s otolaryngologist expert, Dr. Dinesh Chhetry, testified that\n\nDr. Seely did not breach the standard of care for either procedure. He\n\nspecifically explained that to injure the vagus nerve, Dr. Seely would have had to\n\ncut through muscle and fat beyond the tonsillar tissue, of which no evidence\n\nexists.\n\n          Over the course of the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel consistently arrived late and\n\nbudgeted time poorly. The court repeatedly admonished counsel and articulated\n\nthat time management, not the unwieldiness of the medical bill exhibits, caused\n\nthe drawn-out proceedings.\n\n          Following extensive testimony from both parties, the jury determined in an\n\n11 to 1 verdict that Dr. Seely had not been negligent in either procedure and did\n\nnot fail to obtain informed consent. Belisle appeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                   Summary Judgment\n\n          Belisle asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\ndismissing her informed consent claim against Dr. Zundel. She also asserts that\n\nthe trial court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment concerning the\n\nadmission of medical bills as reasonable and necessary. To the former,\n\nProliance contends that summary judgment is appropriate because Dr. Zundel\n\nhad no legal duty to obtain informed consent for a procedure he did not perform.\n\nTo the latter, Proliance maintains that the trial court appropriately denied Belisle\u2019s\n\n\n                                            10\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/11\n\n\nmotion to shorten time and did not rule on her motion for summary judgment.\n\nWe conclude the trial court did not err.\n\n       We review a summary judgment order de novo, viewing the facts and\n\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n\nWatkins v.

Informed Consent\n\n       Belisle states that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\ndismissal of the informed consent claim against Dr. Zundel because a genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists as to whether she gave informed consent to a\n\nsecond tonsillectomy by Dr. Seely. Because Belisle conflates the dismissal of\n\nthe informed consent claim against Dr. Zundel with the ultimate jury\n\ndetermination in favor of Dr. Seely, and Dr. Zundel had no legal responsibility for\n\ndamages because of a lack of informed consent for a procedure he did not\n\nperform, we disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/12\n\n\n       Under the doctrine of informed consent, a health care provider has a duty\n\nto disclose relevant facts about the patient\u2019s condition and the proposed course\n\nof treatment to allow the patient to make an informed health care decision.\n\nDavies v. MultiCare Health Sys., 199 Wn.2d 608, 616, 510 P.3d 346 (2022). The\n\ndoctrine rests on the presumption that patients have a right to make decisions\n\nabout their medical treatment. Backlund v. Univ. of Wash., 137 Wn.2d 651, 663,\n\n975 P.2d 950 (1999). A patient may recover for a physician\u2019s failure to provide\n\ninformed consent even if the diagnosis or treatment were not negligent.\n\nBacklund, 137 Wn.2d at 663.\n\n       To prove a breach of the duty to secure informed consent, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish that: (1) the health care provider failed to inform the patient of a\n\nmaterial fact relating to the treatment; (2) the patient consented to treatment\n\nwithout being aware of or fully informed of such material fact; (3) a reasonably\n\nprudent person under similar circumstances would not have consented to the\n\ntreatment if provided with that material fact; and (4) the treatment in question\n\nproximately caused injury. RCW 7.70.050.\n\n       But health care providers do not carry equal informed consent obligations.\n\nSee Alexander v. Gonser, 42 Wn.

Spokane & Inland Empire Blood\n\nBank, 114 Wn.2d 42, 55, 785 P.2d 815 (1990). And RCW 7.70.050 limits\n\n\n                                          12\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/13\n\n\ninformed consent claims to treatment situations. Gomez v. Sauerwein, 180\n\nWn.2d 610, 617, 331 P.3d 19 (2014).\n\n       Belisle claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nbecause the consent form did not mention Dr. Seely and purported to provide\n\nDr. Zundel consent to perform only a laryngoscopy (with possible biopsy) and\n\nesophagoscopy. This conflates a number of different issues.\n\n       To begin, the trial court granted summary judgment dismissing only the\n\ninformed consent claim against Dr. Zundel following a motion for reconsideration.\n\nOn appeal, Belisle does not argue that Dr. Zundel failed to obtain informed\n\nconsent to perform the procedure. Rather, she seems to assert that Dr. Zundel\n\nfailed to obtain informed consent for Dr. Seely to perform the procedure actually\n\nperformed. But no Washington case law or statutory authority provides that a\n\nphysician who did not perform or otherwise control a procedure is liable for a lack\n\nof informed consent for a procedure performed by another physician. And the\n\ntrial court specifically denied summary judgment on the informed consent claim\n\nagainst Dr. Seely.\n\n       Additionally, in addressing the RCW 7.70.050 factors required to prove a\n\nlack of informed consent, Belisle fails to reference Dr. Zundel at all. Belisle\n\nstates that she consented to the procedure without being fully aware of or\n\ninformed of the difference between having a scope through one\u2019s larynx and\n\nesophagus and having a piece of tissue removed, especially by a physician she\n\nalready suspected of \u201cbotching\u201d the initial procedure. She then maintains that\n\nany reasonable person would not have consented given the full information and\n\n\n                                         13\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/14\n\n\nthat Dr. Seely further injured her throat in the process. She makes no assertions\n\nas to Dr. Zundel\u2019s role in the process.\n\n       Because Belisle conflates the dismissed informed consent claim against\n\nDr. Zundel with the maintained claim against Dr. Seely, Dr. Zundel is not liable\n\nfor damages for failure to obtain informed consent on a procedure performed by\n\nDr. Seely, and Belisle fails to establish that Dr. Zundel failed to obtain informed\n\nconsent, summary judgment was proper.\n\n       2. Medical Bills\n\n       Belisle next claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment\n\nconcerning her medical bills was prejudicial error. Because the trial court\n\nproperly denied Belisle\u2019s motion to shorten time and did not rule on her motion\n\nfor summary judgment, Belisle is incorrect.\n\n       \u201cA trial court has discretion when ruling on a motion to shorten time.\u201d\n\nState ex rel. Citizens Against Tolls (CAT) v. Murphy, 151 Wn.2d 226, 236, 88\n\nP.3d 375 (2004). A trial court also has discretion to \u201cachieve the orderly and\n\nexpeditious disposition of cases.\u201d Peluso v. Barton Auto Dealerships, Inc., 138\n\nWn. App. 65, 71, 155 P.3d 978 (2007). Under Civil Rule (CR) 56(c), a motion for\n\nsummary judgment \u201cshall be filed and served not later than 28 calendar days\n\nbefore the hearing.\u201d\n\n       Here, the court initially set trial for October 30, 2023. The scheduling\n\norder required all dispositive motions decided by October 16, 2023, two weeks\n\nbefore trial. Belisle filed her motion for summary judgment on September 28,\n\n2023. Because a motion for summary judgment shall be filed no later than 28\n\n\n                                          14\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/15\n\n\ndays before the hearing, the hearing on Belisle\u2019s motion for summary judgment\n\nwould have taken place on October 27, 2023. Recognizing that this placed her\n\noutside the deadline for dispositive motions, Belisle moved to shorten time. She\n\nfailed to provide any legal authority and her only argument was that \u201cthere really\n\nis no genuine issue as to whether these medical records and bills show\n\nreasonable and necessary treatments and billings.\u201d She did not offer any\n\nexplanation as to why she filed the motion for summary judgment late.\n\n       On appeal, Belisle asserts that the trial court erred in denying the motion\n\nto shorten time based on rigid application of technical legal rules rather than the\n\nmerits of the motion. She then contends that the denial of the motion for\n\nsummary judgment prejudiced Belisle because it forced plaintiff\u2019s counsel to\n\nwade through each medical bill individually at trial.\n\n       To the former, Belisle did not provide any explanation as to why her\n\nmotion was filed so late nor any authority as to why she was entitled to a\n\ndispositive ruling on the issue. Her only argument was that \u201c[n]o one here in\n\nanyway [sic] disputes that the medical treatment and billing is reasonable.\u201d But\n\nas Proliance and Dr. Seely articulated, they did clearly contest medical causation\n\nand that causation is central to the reasonableness of medical care and\n\nnecessity of any resulting medical bills. Given the clear deadlines, the lack of\n\nlegal authority, and the lack of explanation as to why the motion was filed beyond\n\nthe deadline in the case scheduling order, we conclude that the trial court did not\n\nmanifestly abuse its discretion in denying Belisle\u2019s motion to shorten time.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/16\n\n\n       To the latter, we conclude that Belisle misrepresents the trial court\u2019s order\n\nand fails to establish resulting prejudice because the trial court specifically stated,\n\noutside the presence of the jury, that any delay resulted from the plaintiff\u2019s poor\n\ntime management.\n\n       Again, Belisle asserts that the trial court erred in denying her motion for\n\nsummary judgment. But the trial court did not rule on her motion for summary\n\njudgment. And Belisle fails to establish that any of the supposed prejudice\n\nactually resulted from the denial of the motion to shorten time.\n\n       The record confirms that plaintiff\u2019s counsel repeatedly arrived to court late,\n\nasked repetitive questions that unnecessarily extended testimony, and failed to\n\nadequately allocate time for more relevant evidence. In fact, when plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncounsel approached double the amount of time he had estimated for more than\n\none witness, the court stated:\n              I have seen \u2014 so far all the extra time \u2014 you keep pointing\n       to the medical bills as reason you need more time. But everything\n       I\u2019ve observed are delays coming from other reasons. . . .\n             I\u2019m just warning you, you need to be efficient with presenting\n       your case. And, frankly, what I\u2019m observing is not efficient.\n\nBelisle suggests that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant her summary judgment\n\nmotion forced her to march through the bills one by one, causing the inefficiency.\n\nThis inefficiency then frustrated the court, leading to admonishment Belisle\n\ncontends constituted an expression of bias in front of the jury. But as noted, the\n\nrecord shows that while the delays may have centered on the medical bills, they\n\nresulted from plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel could have moved\n\nthrough the individual exhibits in a smoother and more efficient manner.\n\n\n                                          16\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/17\n\n\n       Additionally, any admonishment from the court often took place outside of\n\nthe presence of the jury. As a result, the jury would not have been impacted by\n\nany alleged expression of bias.\n\n       Because the court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying\n\nBelisle\u2019s motion to shorten time and the denial did not prejudice her case, the trial\n\ncourt did not err.\n\n                                 Evidentiary Rulings\n\n       Belisle contends that the trial court erred in limiting Belisle\u2019s medical\n\ntestimony, allowing Proliance\u2019s late-disclosed expert to testify, and precluding\n\nargument about Dr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis. Proliance disagrees,\n\nnoting that the record does not display any such limitation, Proliance\u2019s expert did\n\nnot testify at trial, and Belisle failed to establish the diagnosis\u2019s relevance. We\n\nagree with Proliance.\n\n       We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. Bengtsson v.\n\nSunnyworld Int\u2019l, Inc., 14 Wn. App. 2d 91, 99, 469 P.3d 339 (2020). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion if its ruling is manifestly unreasonable or based on\n\nuntenable grounds or reasons. Bengtsson, 14 Wn. App. 2d at 99. But an\n\nevidentiary error is only grounds for reversal if it results in prejudice. Bengtsson,\n\n14 Wn. App. 2d at 99. \u201c \u2018An error is prejudicial if \u2018within reasonable probabilities,\n\nhad the error not occurred, the outcome of the trial would have been materially\n\naffected.\u2019 \u201d Bengtsson, 14 Wn. App. 2d at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting City of Seattle v. Pearson, 192 Wn. App. 802, 817, 369 P.3d 194\n\n(2016)).\n\n\n                                          17\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/18\n\n\n       1. Medical Testimony\n\n       Belisle states that the trial court erred by granting a motion in limine that\n\n\u201ceffectively muzzled\u201d her; limiting her ability to testify to her own medical\n\nconditions and diagnoses in the language she would normally use as a trained\n\nand experienced nurse. Because the record does not display any such limitation\n\nand Belisle fails to provide legal authority to support her argument, the court did\n\nnot err.\n\n       Generally, an appellate brief must include \u201cargument in support of the\n\nissues presented for review, together with citations to legal authority and\n\nreferences to relevant parts of the record.\u201d RAP 10.3(a)(6).\n\n       Belisle claims that the trial court granted Proliance\u2019s motion in limine,\n\nimproperly precluding Belisle from testifying about medical issues in the\n\nlanguage she would normally use as a trained emergency nurse. But the portion\n\nof the record that Belisle cites in support of her claim addresses a Proliance\n\nmotion attempting to preclude expert witnesses from testifying specifically to\n\ncausation. Belisle is not an expert witness and the trial court denied Proliance\u2019s\n\nmotion.\n\n       Proliance did move to preclude Belisle from testifying about her mental\n\nand emotional pain and suffering later in the record but the trial court again\n\ndenied that motion. And the trial court reserved ruling on a motion to exclude\n\nnon-physician testimony on medical facts, standards of care, and causation,\n\nspecifically noting, \u201cpresumably some people can testify to what we might call\n\nmedical facts, for example, . . . [Belisle is] not a physician \u2014 well, she is a nurse.\u201d\n\n\n                                          18\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/19\n\n\nThe record does not support Belisle\u2019s assertion that the trial court granted any\n\nparticular motion in limine.\n\n       In addition to misrepresenting the record, Belisle presents no legal\n\nauthority to support her argument that the trial court acted improperly. Instead,\n\nBelisle makes the broad statement that \u201cit simply cannot be an accurate\n\nstatement of the law that a plaintiff with twenty years\u2019 experience as an ER nurse\n\ncannot bring that experience to bear on her own understanding of the diagnoses\n\nand treatments she received.\u201d She provides no case law or statutory authority to\n\nexplain why that simply cannot be the case. She then continues on to request\n\nthat this court draw \u201ca clearer line than currently exists in Washington law.\u201d\n\n       Because Belisle provides no citations to legal authority nor references to\n\nrelevant parts of the record, we conclude the trial court did not improperly limit\n\nBelisle\u2019s testimony.\n\n       2. Expert Testimony\n\n       Belisle next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Michael\n\nRubenstein, a late-disclosed Proliance expert witness to testify. Because the trial\n\ncourt acted appropriately in refusing to exclude Dr. Rubenstein under Burnet v.\n\nSpokane Ambulance, 131 Wn.2d 484, 933 P.2d 1036 (1997), and Dr. Rubenstein\n\ndid not actually testify at trial, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion and no prejudice occurred.\n\n       Before determining that exclusion of a witness is an appropriate sanction\n\nfor late-disclosure, a trial court must explicitly consider whether the late-\n\ndisclosure was willful or deliberate, whether it substantially prejudiced the\n\n\n                                           19\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/20\n\n\nopposing party\u2019s attempts to prepare for trial, and whether lesser sanctions would\n\nsuffice. Burnet, 131 Wn.2d at 1040-41.\n\n       We review a trial court\u2019s application of the Burnet factors for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Scott v. Grader, 105 Wn. App. 136, 152, 18 P.3d 1150 (2001). But\n\nan error, including an abuse of discretion, is harmless if it is \u201c \u2018trivial, or formal, or\n\nmerely academic, and was not prejudicial to the substantial rights of the party\n\nassigning it, and in no way affected the final outcome of the case.\u2019 \u201d Veit v.\n\nBurlington N. Santa Fe Corp, 171 Wn.2d 88, 99, 249 P.3d 607 (2011) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Mackay v. Acorn Custom Cabinetry, Inc., 127\n\nWn.2d 302, 311, 898 P.2d 284 (1995)).\n\n       Here, Proliance disclosed Dr. Rubenstein as a new expert after the April\n\n2023 discovery cutoff but six weeks before trial. Proliance asserted that good\n\ncause existed to allow Dr. Rubenstein to testify because he would rebut new\n\ndeclarations Belisle submitted in response to an August 2023 summary judgment\n\nmotion. Proliance further contended that the late disclosure was neither willful\n\nnor prejudicial given Belisle\u2019s new declarations.\n\n       In response to Proliance\u2019s motion, Belisle did not discuss any of the\n\nBurnet factors. Rather, Belisle stated only, \u201c[m]y neurosurgeon says that if this is\n\nallowed that I must also get a neurologist to support him and not be 2 of the\n\ndefendants\u2019 experts versus just him.\u201d\n\n       The trial court then marched through the Burnet factors, noting that Belisle\n\ndid not dispute Proliance\u2019s assertion that the proposed witness served to respond\n\nto new opinions set forth in her own expert declarations, that Belisle failed to\n\n\n                                            20\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/21\n\n\narticulate why she would need a new expert if Dr. Rubenstein was not excluded,\n\nand that any prejudice could be easily mitigated. Although the trial court did not\n\nexplicitly address whether lesser sanctions would suffice, Belisle presented no\n\nargument as to why only exclusion was appropriate and the court clearly\n\narticulated that each Burnet factor failed to justify excluding Dr. Rubenstein as a\n\nwitness.\n\n       Additionally, Proliance did not call Dr. Rubenstein to testify at trial. As a\n\nresult, the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude Dr. Rubenstein as a potential witness in\n\nno way affected the final outcome of the case. Therefore, any error would be\n\nharmless.\n\n       We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\n\nexclude Dr. Rubenstein from the witness list and no resulting prejudice occurred.\n\n       3. Parkinson\u2019s Diagnosis\n\n       Belisle then contends that the trial court erred in excluding argument about\n\nDr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis because the diagnosis could have\n\nbeen the causal link to establish Dr. Seely\u2019s negligence. Because Belisle failed\n\nto present any evidence to support this claim, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in excluding argument linking the diagnosis to negligence on Dr.\n\nSeely\u2019s part.\n\n       Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. ER 402. Evidence is\n\nrelevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact of consequence\n\nmore or less probable. ER 401.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/22\n\n\n       Belisle asserts that Dr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease likely impacted his\n\nability to perform surgery at the time of her operation and that his later diagnosis\n\nis clearly relevant evidence. She fails, however, to provide any evidence at all\n\nthat Dr. Seely was impacted by the disease at the time of her surgery. Before\n\nthe trial court, Belisle stated only, \u201cWikipedia, everybody is saying [Parkinson\u2019s\n\ndisplays early signs].\u201d She did not provide any expert testimony, nor did she\n\nexplain who \u201ceverybody\u201d is. And when asked specifically by the court for any\n\nadmissible evidence that Dr. Seely may have suffered Parkinson\u2019s symptoms at\n\nthe time of surgery, Belisle conceded, \u201cno, I don\u2019t have any evidence, Your\n\nHonor.\u201d\n\n       Belisle next suggests that this lack of evidence is immaterial because\n\nProliance sprung the diagnosis on opposing counsel at trial and Belisle did not\n\nhave time to find an expert witness. But, in April 2023, Belisle deposed Dr. Seely\n\nfor three hours and had ample opportunity to discover Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis. In\n\nfact, Dr. Seely disclosed in that deposition that he left the practice on medical\n\nleave in May 2018. Belisle did not ask any further questions about that medical\n\nleave. Neither Dr. Seely nor defense counsel hid the diagnosis from Belisle at\n\nany point. 2\n\n       2  At oral argument, Belisle\u2019s attorney contended that the exclusion of\nDr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis implicated a discovery issue because\nProliance denied Belisle\u2019s attempts to uncover Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis. The record\ndoes not reflect any such denial. No indication exists that Dr. Seely failed to\nrespond to any discovery requests concerning his health. To the contrary,\nBelisle\u2019s trial attorney noted that they were unaware of any diagnosis until\nProliance raised the issue as a motion in limine. And even had Belisle been able\nto prove discovery interference, she admitted to a complete lack of evidence\nconnecting Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis with the alleged injury. Furthermore, Belisle did\n\n                                         22\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/23\n\n\n       Here, Belisle failed to provide any admissible evidence indicating that\n\nDr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease impacted her surgery. As a result, the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in precluding argument based on the diagnosis.\n\n                               Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       Belisle claims that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the\n\njury\u2019s determination that Dr. Seely was not negligent. Proliance first contends\n\nthat Belisle failed to preserve the issue for appeal. Proliance then asserts that\n\nsubstantial evidence supported the verdict and Belisle improperly asks this court\n\nto reweigh evidence.\n\n       Generally, a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal.\n\nRAP 2.5(a). A party may only raise an issue for the first time if it addresses lack\n\nof jurisdiction, failure to establish facts upon which relief can be granted, or\n\nmanifest constitutional error. RAP 2.5(a). When a party does not present a claim\n\nof insufficiency of the evidence to the trial court, it is not subject to review on\n\nappeal. Fowlkes v. International Broth. of Elec. Workers, Local No. 76, 58 Wn.\n\nApp. 759, 772-73, 759 P.2d 137 (1990).\n\n       Belisle did not raise the issue of insufficient evidence before the jury\n\nverdict nor did she move for a new trial or reconsideration after the verdict. We\n\nconclude that Belisle failed to raise the issue below and none of the RAP 2.5(a)\n\nexclusions apply.\n\n\n\n\nnot move for a continuance to conduct additional discovery or obtain more\nevidence.\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/24\n\n\n                      University of Washington Involvement\n\n       Lastly, Belisle assigns error on the basis that newly discovered evidence\n\nwould have been material to the outcome of the trial.

If newly discovered evidence arises after the close of trial,\n\nCR 59(a)(4) allows a party to move for a new trial provided that evidence would\n\nnot have been discovered and produced at trial. CR 60(b)(3) then allows relief\n\nfrom judgment if newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered in\n\ntime to move for a new trial.\n\n       On appeal, a party must include legal authority and references to the\n\nrecord in support of the issues presented for review.

Belisle claimed that Dr. Seely and others were negligent in performing the surgery, which caused her injury. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants, and Belisle appealed, arguing that the trial court made several errors, including dismissing certain claims and limiting her testimony. The court of appeals found no error and affirmed the jury's verdict.\n\n**Key legal issue:** Medical malpractice and informed consent\n**Type of injury:** Nerve damage\n**Outcome:** Jury verdict in favor of defendants, affirmed by the court of appeals."

For the following reasons,\nthe Court orders Pulaski to authorize the surgery and pay additional temporary disability\nbenefits.\n\n                                    History of Claim\n\n       Mr. Brown suffered a work injury on February 1, 2023, when a bucket from a boom\ntruck struck him on the head as it was lowered to the ground. He immediately went to the\nemergency room, where he reported neck, back, and right-shoulder pain but no weakness\nor numbness. Multiple CT scans did not reveal any acute abnormalities.\n\n        When Mr. Brown\u2019s pain did not improve with conservative treatment, Pulaski\nauthorized him to see board-certified orthopedic spine specialist Dr. Qamirani. At his first\nvisit in March, Mr. Brown complained of \u201c9 out of 10 level\u201d stabbing pain on the right side\nof his neck that radiated to the top of both shoulders and down the thoracic spine as well\nas occasional numbness in his right shoulder and hand.\n\n       Dr. Qamirani diagnosed a cervical sprain and ordered a cervical MRI, which\noccurred in April. According to the radiologist, the MRI revealed \u201coverall mild\ndegenerative changes resulting in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis C3-C4. No central\n\n                                             1\n\fprotruded disc or central canal stenosis.\u201d However, Dr. Qamirani disagreed with this\ninterpretation. He described the MRI as revealing a \u201cC3-4 bulging disc with severe right\nand moderate left foraminal stenosis.\u201d\n\n       Dr. Qamirani treated Mr. Brown with steroid injections, but he still experienced \u201c8\nout of 10\u201d pain in his neck and shoulders with occasional numbness in his right upper\nextremity. He also complained of frequent migraines. Dr. Qamirani ordered additional\nphysical therapy but noted that a cervical fusion might be necessary if Mr. Brown did not\nsignificantly improve.\n\n       Mr. Brown still had not improved by his next visit in August. In addition to his\nother complaints, he reported numbness in his left arm and fingers. Based on the lack of\nimprovement and the severity of symptoms, Dr. Qamirani recommended a C3-C4 disc\nfusion. He cautioned that he would discharge Mr. Brown from treatment if Pulaski denied\nthe surgery.\n\n        Pulaski sent the surgery recommendation through utilization review to a board-\ncertified orthopedist, Dr. Sean Lager. Dr. Lager said that Dr. Qamirani\u2019s MRI review was\ninconsistent with the radiologist\u2019s, and Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms were not in line with\nobjective tests. He also said that no neurological deficits were present at the C3-4 level.\nDr. Lager further noted that Mr. Brown smoked, which led to unsuccessful fusions. Thus,\nhe denied the surgery.\n\n       Mr. Brown appealed the decision to the Bureau\u2019s medical directors. Dr. Robert\nSnyder and Dr. James Talmage, both orthopedists, agreed with Dr. Lager. The denial letter\nsaid that the procedure was not medically necessary.\n\n        Dr. Qamirani discharged Mr. Brown, and Pulaski authorized Dr. Robert Clendenin,\nphysical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, to see him in October. Mr. Brown told Dr.\nClendenin that he suffered a new onset of pain in July or August, so that it now radiated\ninto the left arm as well as the right. Dr. Clendenin ordered a second cervical MRI and\nbilateral upper extremity EMGs.\n\n       At the next visit, Dr. Clendenin noted the MRI revealed severe right foraminal\nstenosis and moderate to severe left stenosis due to spondylosis at C3-4 that impinged upon\nthe exiting right nerve roots. The EMGs showed evidence of mild cubital tunnel syndrome\non the right. However, Dr. Clendenin did not see any evidence of a disc herniation or acute\nradiculopathy. He said he could not verify any of Mr. Brown\u2019s pain complaints or see any\nabnormality he could attribute to the work injury. He placed Mr. Brown at maximum\nmedical improvement and referred him to pain management for possible cervical nerve\nblocks and medication management.\n\n       Pulaski then transferred Mr. Brown\u2019s care to physiatrist Kenneth Sykes, M.D. At\n\n                                            2\n\fthe first visit in January 2024, Mr. Brown complained of bilateral neck pain that radiated\nto both arms as well as numbness and tingling in both arms, the left being worse than the\nright. Dr. Sykes performed a nerve block at C3-C4 that provided a few hours\u2019 relief. He\nordered a right-shoulder MRI that showed moderate AC joint degeneration but no rotator\ncuff tear.\n\n      Dr. Sykes then performed an ablation at C3-4, which gave some pain relief. But\nMr. Brown continued to experience significant symptoms, so Dr Sykes recommended he\nundergo a third cervical MRI in June.\n\n       According to this MRI report, Mr. Brown suffered from mild to moderate disc\nbulges with mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis at C3-4, C4-5, and C6-7. Dr.\nSykes said he did not have any further treatment options. However, he did note that Mr.\nBrown had successfully completed a smoking cessation program. On July 15, he placed\nMr. Brown at maximum medical improvement with a 4% impairment and said he did not\nanticipate any further treatment for Mr. Brown\u2019s neck.\n\n       However, Mr. Brown returned to Dr. Sykes in October with continuing pain that he\napportioned as 50% in the neck and 50% in the shoulders and arms. He also complained\nof constant headaches and numbness and tingling in his left arm. Dr. Sykes took Mr.\nBrown off work on October 28 and referred him back to Dr. Qamirani.\n\n       Dr. Qamirani saw Mr. Brown for the last time in November. Mr. Brown reported\n50% neck pain and 50% arm/shoulder pain, mostly in the left arm. He also complained of\nnumbness and weakness in both arms. Dr. Qamirani reviewed the June MRI, and he again\ndiffered with the radiologist as to the severity of the stenosis and nerve compression. He\nrepeated his recommendation for a cervical fusion at C3-4 and restricted Mr. Brown from\nworking until he had the surgery.\n\n       As before, Pulaski sent the recommendation to Dr. Lager for utilization review. Dr.\nLager quoted extensively from the 2023 denial, again observing that Dr. Qamirani\u2019s\nopinion that the April 2023 MRI showed severe foraminal stenosis was inconsistent with\nthe \u201cofficial\u201d MRI reading by the radiologist. He did not mention the October 2023 MRI\nor Dr. Sykes\u2019s records but did list them as records he reviewed. He referred to the June\n2024 MRI record but said that it only revealed mild bilateral stenosis, facet arthropathy,\nand a \u201cshallow left paracentral disc protrusion\u201d at C3-4. He did not see any evidence of\nneural compression or focal neurologic deficits. Once again he denied the fusion.\n\n      Mr. Brown appealed the utilization review denial to Dr. Snyder, who once again\nagreed, asserting it was not clear that the procedure would alleviate Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms\ndue to a history of headaches and shoulder involvement. He recommended \u201cfurther\ndiagnostic studies, EMG/NCV and second opinion.\u201d\n\n\n                                            3\n\f        In addition to medical records, Mr. Brown submitted Dr. Qamirani\u2019s deposition. He\nfirst established that Mr. Brown\u2019s injuries and need for a C-4 fusion primarily arose out of\nhis work-related injury. Mr. Brown required surgery because he developed pain in his left\narm and shoulder, and conservative treatment did not relieve his symptoms. He would not\nreach maximum medical improvement until after surgery.\n\n        As for the utilization review reports, Dr. Qamirani expressed concern that Dr. Lager\nfound significance in the fact that there were no neurological deficits at C4. He believed\nthis statement showed that Dr. Lager apparently did not know that the C4 nerve is a sensory\nnerve. Thus, compression would only cause pain, not neurological deficits.\n\n        On cross-examination, Dr. Qamirani confirmed his opinion that the April 2023 MRI\nshowed a C3-4 bulging disc with \u201csevere right and moderate left foraminal stenosis.\u201d He\ntestified that when he reviewed the June 2024 MRI film, he believed that it showed the\nsame level of stenosis he found in the April 2023 MRI, despite the radiologist\u2019s report of\nmild stenosis. Finally, Dr. Qamirani drew attention to the October 2023 MRI, noting that\nthe radiologist found evidence of severe foraminal stenosis at C3-4, which was much more\nin line with his own findings.\n\n       Pulaski offered Dr. Clendenin\u2019s deposition for its proof. When he first saw Mr.\nBrown, he complained of a recent onset of left-arm pain, so Dr. Clendenin ordered a\ncervical MRI. It was performed in October 2023 and revealed many degenerative arthritic\nchanges with severe right foraminal narrowing causing impingement of the C4 nerve root.\nHowever, he did not see any acute changes from the first MRI to account for the onset of\nleft-arm symptoms.\n\n       Dr. Clendenin said that he did not see any acute radiculopathy, and Mr. Brown\u2019s\npain was widespread and \u201cway out of the distribution of the C4.\u201d Surgery was not an\noption because the MRI only revealed degenerative and osteoarthritic changes with no\nacute disc herniations and did not correlate Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms with the MRI findings.\n\n        Dr. Clendenin testified that after he performed unsuccessful nerve blocks, he felt he\nhad exhausted treatment options and released Mr. Brown in November 2023. He admitted\nto not reviewing any records of Mr. Brown\u2019s later treatment, but he was not optimistic that\nsurgery would relieve Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms.\n\n       On the issue of temporary disability benefits, Mr. Brown\u2019s affidavit stated that his\nlast payment for temporary disability benefits was on July 15, 2024. He was seeking\nbenefits from July 16, 2024, to the present and has not worked during this period because\nof his work injury.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                       Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n       To obtain his requested benefits, Mr. Brown must show a likelihood of prevailing\nat a hearing on the merits that he is entitled to cervical fusion surgery and additional\ntemporary disability benefits. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-6-239(d)(1) (2024).\n\n        To establish entitlement, Mr. Brown must show he is likely to prove: (1) a work-\nrelated injury; (2) that surgery is reasonable and necessary for treating his injury; and (3)\nhe has yet to reach maximum medical improvement and has been unable to work since he\nlast received temporary disability benefits. The Court will address each issue in turn.\n\n        To prove a work-related injury, Mr. Brown must show that he sustained an injury\narising primarily arose out of and in the course of employment. \u00a7 50-6-102(14)(A). Dr.\nQamirani, the authorized physician, testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\nthat Mr. Brown\u2019s current symptoms of neck pain with radiation into both shoulders and\narms primarily arose out of this accident. This opinion is presumed correct. \u00a7 50-6-\n102(14)(E). Pulaski did not submit contrary medical evidence, so the Court holds that Mr.\nBrown is likely to prove at a hearing that his cervical injury arose primarily in the course\nand scope of his employment.\n\n       The more complex issue is whether Dr. Qamirani\u2019s recommendation for a cervical\nfusion is reasonable and necessary to treat Mr. Brown\u2019s current symptoms.\n\n        The Appeals Board has held that \u201cthe utilization review system is intended to ensure\nthe availability of quality medical care services for injured and disabled employees and to\nmanage medical costs in workers\u2019 compensation matters.\u201d Gentry v. Arapazuma, Inc.,\n2022 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 30, at *12 (July 19, 2022). The burden of\nproduction is on an employer who chooses to challenge treatment prescribed by an\nauthorized physician. Id. at *14. A trial court \u201cis not bound by the determination of\nthe utilization review physician or the Bureau\u2019s Medical Director but is charged with\nconducting a de novo review to determine whether Employer rebutted the presumption that\nthe prescribed treatment is reasonably necessary to treat the work injury.\u201d Id.\n\n       On this issue, the medical evidence materially differs. When confronted with\nconflicting opinions, the Court has discretion to determine which opinion to accept.\nPatterson v. Huff & Puff Trucking, 2018 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 33, at *9 (July\n6, 2018). The Court may consider, among other things, \u201cthe qualifications of the experts,\nthe circumstances of their examination, the information available to them, and the\nevaluation of the importance of that information by other experts.\u201d Orman v. Williams\nSonoma, Inc., 803 S.W.2d 672, 676 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       Here, Dr. Qamirani is a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon with years of\nexperience. Dr. Clendenin is a board-certified physical medicine and rehabilitation\n\n                                             5\n\fspecialist. According to the utilization review report, Dr. Lager is a board-certified\northopedist. Drs. Snyder and Talmage are both board-certified orthopedists as well. While\nall the doctors are qualified to address cervical spine issues, the Court finds that Dr.\nQamirani, as a spine surgeon, is more qualified to address the reasonableness and necessity\nof a cervical fusion than the other physicians.\n\n       As to the circumstances of their examinations, Dr. Qamirani is Mr. Brown\u2019s\nauthorized treating physician, which entitles his opinion as to the reasonableness and\nnecessity of recommended treatment to a presumption of correctness. \u00a7 50-6-204(H). He\npersonally evaluated Mr. Brown several times, which allowed him to assess Mr. Brown\u2019s\ncredibility and his response to various modes of treatment. He was also the last doctor to\ntreat Mr. Brown. \u201cIt seems reasonable that the physicians having greater contact with the\nPlaintiff would have the advantage and opportunity to provide a more in-depth opinion, if\nnot a more accurate one.\u201d Id. at 677.\n\n      Dr. Clendenin saw Mr. Brown twice before releasing him and assigning maximum\nmedical improvement. He did not see Mr. Brown after he discharged him in 2023 and\nknew nothing of his later treatment. The other doctors who addressed the surgery issue\nonly performed record reviews. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that Dr.\nQamirani\u2019s history with Mr. Brown gives more weight to his opinion.\n\n       Finally, the Court considers the information available to each doctor and the weight\ngiven to this information. For this factor, the multiple cervical MRIs and the doctors\u2019\ninterpretations of them become significant. Dr. Qamirani disagreed with the radiologist\u2019s\nreports for the April 2023 and the November 2024 MRIs, concluding the film showed\nsevere foraminal stenosis rather than the mild stenosis the radiologist reported. He also\npointed out that the October 2023 MRI report supported his opinion. Dr. Qamirani is the\nonly doctor who documented reviewing the actual film.\n\n       Dr. Lager relied on the difference between Dr. Qamirani\u2019s and the radiologist\u2019s\nopinions of the severity of the foraminal stenosis in denying surgery. He also described\nthe 2024 MRI as only showing mild stenosis when the report described it as mild to\nmoderate. More significantly, he did not mention the October 2023 MRI report or Dr.\nSykes\u2019s records for the second utilization review denial except to list them as documents\nhe reviewed. Finally, Dr. Qamirani noted his concern that it did not appear Dr. Lager was\naware that the nerve at C3-4 was a sensory nerve and compression would cause only pain\nwith no neurological deficits. Pulaski did not produce any contrary evidence.\n\n       As for the medical directors\u2019 decisions upholding the utilization review denials,\nneither doctor offered justification for the denials.\n\n       For Dr. Clendenin\u2019s part, he acknowledged that the October 2023 MRI showed\nsevere foraminal stenosis at C3-4, which compressed the nerve root on the right. This is\n\n                                            6\n\fconsistent with Dr. Qamirani\u2019s assessment.\n\n       Dr. Clendenin also agreed that Mr. Brown complained of left-shoulder/arm pain\nwhen he saw him, although he gave a different weight to this fact than Dr. Qamirani. He\nbelieved the left-sided symptoms weighed against surgery, since Mr. Brown did not\nmention pain immediately after the accident. Dr. Qamirani felt the opposite, citing the fact\nthat Mr. Brown complained of pain that was 50% in his left shoulder/arm and 50% in the\nneck at his 2024 visit.\n\n       After considering the above, the Court finds that the information considered by the\ndoctors and the weight they gave to it also favors Dr. Qamirani\u2019s opinion.\n\n        Another significant factor is that no doctor has presented any other non-surgical\noptions to relieve Mr. Brown\u2019s complaints. He has undergone multiple courses of\nconservative treatment with no significant improvement. Likewise, no doctor has said that\nMr. Brown was not credible or that his symptoms were not real. The fact that Dr. Qamirani\nis offering a possible solution must weigh in favor of surgery. The Appeals Board upheld\na trial court order to authorize surgery, where the medical experts disagreed on its\nreasonable necessity, but they offered \u201cno countervailing recommendations for reasonable\nand necessary medical treatment.\u201d Burns-Herrera v. State Indus., LLC, 2022 TN Wrk.\nComp. App. Bd. LEXIS 37, at *17 (Sept. 12, 2022). The Court finds that the information\nconsidered by the doctors and the weight they gave to it also favors Dr. Qamirani.\n\n       After weighing all the evidence, the Court finds that Pulaski failed to overcome the\npresumption given to Dr. Qamirani\u2019s opinion. Mr. Brown has proven he is likely to prevail\nat a hearing on the merits regarding entitlement to surgery, and Pulaski must authorize the\nrecommended fusion at C3-4.\n\n       As to temporary total disability benefits, Mr. Brown must show the duration of his\nwork-related inability to work. See Shepherd v. Haren Const. Co., Inc., 2016 TN Wrk.\nComp. App. Bd. LEXIS 15, at *13 (Mar. 30, 2016). Mr. Brown requested benefits from\nJuly 16, 2024, through the present. He stated he has not worked since that time, and Pulaski\ndid not dispute that assertion. However, Dr. Sykes placed Mr. Brown at maximum medical\nimprovement on July 15, 2024, and did not take him off work again until October 28, when\nhe referred him back to Dr. Qamirani.\n\n        Dr. Qamirani then took Mr. Brown off work on November 11, 2024, until he\nundergoes the recommended surgery. He testified that Mr. Brown would not be at\nmaximum medical improvement until he had the surgery. However, he did not dispute that\nMr. Brown was at maximum medical improvement on July 15, 2024, and Dr. Sykes never\nrescinded that opinion. Thus, Mr. Brown has not met his burden of proving temporary\ntotal disability from July 16, 2024, through October 27, 2024.\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       However, given that the Court has determined that the surgery is reasonable and\nnecessary, it follows that, based on Dr. Qamirani\u2019s testimony, Mr. Brown is also likely to\nprove that he has been temporarily totally disabled from at least October 28, 2024, through\nthe present and will remain so until he undergoes surgery. Thus, he is likely to prevail at\na hearing on the merits regarding this request. The Court holds that Mr. Brown is entitled\nto temporary total disability benefits at the compensation rate of $919.07 from October 28,\n2024, forward.\n\n       IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that:\n\n 1. Pulaski shall authorize and pay for Dr. Qamirani to perform the recommended fusions\n    at C3-4.\n\n 2. Pulaski shall pay Mr. Brown past temporary total disability benefits of $36,237.62.\n    Mr. Brown\u2019s attorney is entitled to 20% attorney\u2019s fees, or $7,247.52. Pulaski shall\n    continue to pay Mr. Brown temporary total disability benefits at the rate of $919.07\n    until he reaches maximum medical improvement or is able to return to work.\n\n 3.

To do so, you must:\n   1. Complete the enclosed form entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d and file it with the Clerk of the\n      Court of Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims before the expiration of the deadline.\n              \u00be If the order being appealed is \u201cexpedited\u201d (also called \u201cinterlocutory\u201d), or if the\n                 order does not dispose of the case in its entirety, the notice of appeal must be filed\n                 within seven (7) business days of the date the order was filed.\n              \u00be If the order being appealed is a \u201cCompensation Order,\u201d or if it resolves all issues\n                 in the case, the notice of appeal must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of\n                 the date the Compensation Order was filed.\n      When filing the Notice of Appeal, you must serve a copy on the opposing party (or attorney,\n      if represented).\n\n   2. You must pay, via check, money order, or credit card, a $75.00 filing fee within ten calendar\n      days after filing the Notice of Appeal. Payments can be made in-person at any Bureau office\n      or by U.S. mail, hand-delivery, or other delivery service. In the alternative, you may file an\n      Affidavit of Indigency (form available on the Bureau\u2019s website or any Bureau office)\n      seeking a waiver of the filing fee. You must file the fully-completed Affidavit of Indigency\n      within ten calendar days of filing the Notice of Appeal. Failure to timely pay the filing\n      fee or file the Affidavit of Indigency will result in dismissal of your appeal.\n\n   3. You are responsible for ensuring a complete record is presented on appeal. If no court\n      reporter was present at the hearing, you may request from the Court Clerk the audio\n      recording of the hearing for a $25.00 fee. If you choose to submit a transcript as part of your\n      appeal, which the Appeals Board has emphasized is important for a meaningful review of\n      the case, a licensed court reporter must prepare the transcript, and you must file it with the\n      Court Clerk. The Court Clerk will prepare the record for submission to the Appeals Board,\n      and you will receive notice once it has been submitted. For deadlines related to the filing of\n      transcripts, statements of the evidence, and briefs on appeal, see the applicable rules on the\n      Bureau\u2019s website at https://www.tn.gov/wcappealsboard.

In two issues, Reyes contends that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting Fiesta\u2019s hybrid motion for summary judgment because (1) she presented\n\fevidence that Fiesta had actual or constructive knowledge of the premises condition\n\nand (2) adequate time for discovery had not elapsed at the time the trial court granted\n\nthe motion.\n\n       We affirm.\n\n                                     Background\n\n       In her petition, Reyes alleged that on October 30, 2020, she was shopping at\n\nthe Fiesta grocery store located at 2877 Rickey Street, in Houston, Texas, when she\n\nslipped and fell on a substance on the floor of the produce department, injuring\n\nherself.\n\n       Reyes sued Fiesta asserting claims for negligence and premises liability. She\n\nalleged that her fall and resulting injuries were caused by Fiesta\u2019s failure to properly\n\nmaintain its premises in a safe manner. With respect to her premises liability claim,\n\nReyes alleged that (1) she was an invitee, (2) Fiesta was a possessor of the premises,\n\n(3) a condition on the premises posed an unreasonable risk of harm, (4) Fiesta knew\n\nor reasonably should have known of the danger, (5) Fiesta breached its duty of\n\nordinary care by failing to (a) adequately warn Reyes of the condition and (b) make\n\nthe condition reasonably safe, and (6) Fiesta\u2019s breach proximately caused her\n\ninjuries.\n\n       Fiesta answered, generally denying the allegations in Reyes\u2019s petition and\n\nasserting certain defenses and limitations on liability and damages.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      Fiesta filed a hybrid traditional and no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment. As to its no-evidence motion, Fiesta asserted that an adequate time for\n\ndiscovery had elapsed and Reyes could not produce any evidence to support the\n\nnotice element of her premises liability claim. As to its traditional motion, Fiesta\n\nasserted that even if Reyes had produced more than a scintilla of evidence to\n\nestablish each of the essential elements of her claim, her deposition testimony and\n\nwritten admissions conclusively established that Fiesta did not have actual\n\nknowledge of a substance on the floor before Reyes fell. It further asserted that to\n\nprove constructive notice, Reyes was required to provide temporal evidence showing\n\nhow long the condition existed prior to her fall, but she had failed to do so. It also\n\nasserted that Reyes was barred from bringing a general negligence claim against it.1\n\nFiesta attached to its summary judgment motion Reyes\u2019s responses to Fiesta\u2019s first\n\nrequest for admissions, excerpts from Reyes\u2019s deposition transcript, and\n\nphotographs taken by Reyes\u2019s daughter.\n\n\n\n1\n      Fiesta argued that Reyes\u2019s general negligence claim was barred because her\n      allegations gave rise solely to a premises liability claim and that negligence and\n      premises liability claims arising from an alleged unreasonably dangerous condition\n      are mutually exclusive. Reyes did not address this ground either in her summary\n      judgment response in the trial court or in her briefing on appeal and has therefore\n      waived it. See D.R. Horton\u2013Tex., Ltd. v. Markel Int\u2019l Ins. Co., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d\n      740, 743 (Tex. 2009) (concluding failure to present issue to defeat summary\n      judgment in trial court waives issue on appeal); see also TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i)\n      (requiring brief on appeal to contain clear and concise argument for contentions\n      made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to record).\n\n                                           3\n\f      In her summary judgment response, Reyes asserted that Fiesta had actual and\n\nconstructive knowledge of the substance on the floor prior to her fall. According to\n\nReyes, the evidence showed that (1) Fiesta believed the area in which Reyes fell was\n\nopen and obvious and that it had adequately warned her of the conditions, (2) there\n\nwere no signs or cones in the area warning her of the condition, and (3) a Fiesta\n\nemployee was performing his job duties in the area at the time Reyes fell. As\n\nsummary judgment evidence, Reyes attached to her response Fiesta\u2019s original\n\nanswer, its initial disclosures and responses to her requests for production,\n\nphotographs, and Reyes\u2019s deposition transcript.\n\n      In its summary judgment reply, Fiesta asserted that Reyes\u2019s premises liability\n\nclaim failed because she had not presented legally sufficient evidence of Fiesta\u2019s\n\nactual or constructive knowledge of the substance on the floor. Fiesta asserted that\n\nReyes presented no evidence (1) that the Fiesta employee who was stocking nearby\n\nknew there was a substance on the floor, (2) that any Fiesta employee was aware of\n\na substance on the floor prior to Reyes\u2019s fall, and (3) of the length of time the\n\nsubstance had been on the floor prior to her fall. Rather, it asserted, Reyes admitted\n\nthat she had no evidence that Fiesta had actual or constructive knowledge of the\n\nsubstance on the floor where Reyes slipped.\n\n      Reyes filed a supplemental summary judgment response, asserting that Fiesta\n\nhad deliberately withheld discovery responses that would have led to evidence of\n\n\n                                          4\n\fFiesta\u2019s actual and constructive knowledge of the premises condition, and that it had\n\nfailed to preserve evidence that could potentially prove Reyes\u2019s premises liability\n\nclaim. She asserted that Fiesta\u2019s original interrogatory responses, stating that a\n\nFiesta employee had been cleaning the floor at the time that Reyes fell and that Fiesta\n\nhad placed a \u201cwet floor\u201d sign in the area being cleaned, contradicted Fiesta\u2019s\n\nassertion in its summary judgment motion that it did not have knowledge of the\n\ncondition that caused the fall. Reyes attached to her supplemental response Fiesta\u2019s\n\ndiscovery responses, her deposition transcript, and her affidavit. In her affidavit,\n\nReyes stated that there was a Fiesta employee stocking fruit nearby when she fell,\n\nand she did not see any signs warning of a dangerous condition.\n\n         Reyes filed an amended petition, alleging that Fiesta had engaged in spoliation\n\nof evidence and requesting that the trial court grant a spoliation presumption in her\n\nfavor.\n\n         Fiesta filed a supplemental reply in support of its motion for summary\n\njudgment. It argued that Reyes\u2019s failure to conduct discovery was due to her own\n\ninaction rather than the result of nondisclosure by Fiesta. Fiesta reiterated its\n\nassertion that Reyes\u2019s premises liability claim failed because she could not establish\n\nFiesta\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the premises condition. With respect\n\nto Reyes\u2019s spoliation request, Fiesta argued that Reyes had not shown that Fiesta\n\nshould have anticipated litigation and so was not entitled to a spoliation instruction.\n\n\n                                            5\n\fFiesta asserted that it had complied with its duty to amend its answer and discovery\n\nresponses once it obtained additional information related to Reyes\u2019s fall. It attached\n\nthe declaration of Luis Amaro, the Fiesta store manager, to its supplemental reply.\n\nAmaro stated that he did not know there was anything on the floor prior to Reyes\u2019s\n\nfall, and he was neither aware of, nor able to identify, anyone who knew there was\n\nanything on the floor prior to her fall. Amaro further stated that he had reviewed the\n\nstore\u2019s videotape surveillance recording which showed a Fiesta employee cleaning\n\nthe general produce department and that a cone had been placed in the area after\n\nFiesta was notified of Reyes\u2019s fall. Amaro explained that there was no videotaped\n\nrecording of Reyes\u2019s fall or the area itself. Fiesta objected to Reyes\u2019s summary\n\njudgment affidavit and moved to strike it as untimely.\n\n      On June 12, 2023, the trial court held a hearing on Fiesta\u2019s summary judgment\n\nmotion which was continued to July 17, 2023. Following the hearing, on July 17,\n\n2023, the trial court signed an order granting Fiesta summary judgment on Reyes\u2019s\n\nclaims against it. This appeal followed.\n\n                            Summary Judgment\n\n      In her first issue, Reyes contends that the trial court erred in granting Fiesta\n\nsummary judgment on her premises liability claim because she presented more than\n\na scintilla of evidence to support each element of her claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). A party\n\nseeking summary judgment may combine in a single motion a request for summary\n\njudgment under the no-evidence standard with a request under the traditional\n\nsummary judgment standard. Binur v. Jacobo, 135 S.W.3d 646, 650 (Tex. 2004).\n\nWhen, as here, a party has sought summary judgment on both grounds and the order\n\ndoes not specify which motion was granted, we typically first review the propriety\n\nof the summary judgment under the no-evidence standard. See TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n166a(i); Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004). If the\n\nnonmovant fails to meet her burden to adduce evidence in response to the no-\n\nevidence motion, there is no need to address the challenge to the traditional motion\n\nbecause it necessarily fails. Merriman v. XTO Energy, Inc., 407 S.W.3d 244, 248\n\n(Tex. 2013).\n\n      After an adequate time for discovery, a party may move for no-evidence\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that no evidence exists of one or more essential\n\nelements of the claim on which the adverse party bears the burden of proof at trial.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see LMB, Ltd. v. Moreno, 201 S.W.3d 686, 688 (Tex. 2006).\n\nThe burden then shifts to the nonmovant to produce evidence raising a genuine issue\n\nof material fact on the elements specified in the motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i);\n\n\n                                         7\n\fMack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex. 2006). A no-evidence\n\nsummary judgment is improper if the nonmovant brings forth more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. Forbes, Inc. v.

We review the evidence presented by the summary judgment record in the light\n\nmost favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was rendered,\n\ncrediting evidence favorable to that party if reasonable jurors could and disregarding\n\ncontrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. Id. at 582 (citing City of Keller\n\nv. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005)).\n\n      When reviewing a traditional summary judgment motion, we take as true all\n\nevidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we indulge in every reasonable inference\n\nand resolve any doubts in the nonmovant\u2019s favor.

To prevail on a traditional summary judgment motion, the movant\n\nmust establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that it is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\nB.    Applicable Law\n\n      Generally, premises owners owe a duty to protect invitees2 from, or warn them\n\nof, conditions posing unreasonable risks of harm if the owners knew of the\n\nconditions or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of them. Henkel\n\nv. Norman, 441 S.W.3d 249, 251 (Tex. 2014). To prevail on a premises liability\n\nclaim against a property owner, an injured invitee must establish that (1) a premises\n\ncondition created an unreasonable risk of harm to the invitee; (2) the owner knew or\n\nreasonably should have known of the condition; (3) the owner failed to exercise\n\nordinary care to protect the invitee from the danger; and (4) the owner\u2019s failure was\n\na proximate cause of injury to the invitee. Fort Brown Villas III Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc.\n\nv. Gillenwater, 285 S.W.3d 879, 883 (Tex. 2009); CMH Homes, Inc. v. Daenen, 15\n\nS.W.3d 97, 99 (Tex. 2000). The threshold requirement in a premises liability claim\n\nis the existence of actual or constructive knowledge of an unreasonably dangerous\n\n\n\n\n2\n      An invitee is \u201cone who enters on another\u2019s land with the owner\u2019s knowledge and\n      for the mutual benefit of both.\u201d Hillis v. McCall, 602 S.W.3d 436, 440 n.6 (Tex.\n      2020) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n                                           9\n\fcondition on the premises. See Motel 6 G.P., Inc. v. Lopez, 929 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tex.\n\n1996).\n\n      The standard of care required of the owner toward its invitees is the ordinary\n\ncare that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the same or similar\n\ncircumstances. Farrar v. Sabine Mgmt. Corp., 362 S.W.3d 694, 699 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (citing Corbin v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 648 S.W.2d\n\n292, 295 (Tex. 1983)). While a premises owner is not an insurer of its invitees\u2019\n\nsafety, it must protect invitees from conditions on the property that present an\n\nunreasonable risk of harm. Brinson Ford, Inc. v. Alger, 228 S.W.3d 161, 162\u201363\n\n(Tex. 2007).\n\nC.    Notice\n\n      In its summary judgment motion, Fiesta challenged the notice element of\n\nReyes\u2019s premises liability claim. To avoid summary judgment, Reyes was therefore\n\nrequired to present evidence that Fiesta had notice of the premises condition, i.e., the\n\nsubstance on the floor.\n\n      In the context of slip-and-fall cases, a plaintiff satisfies the notice element by\n\nestablishing one of three things: (1) the defendant placed a substance on the floor;\n\n(2) the defendant actually knew the substance was on the floor; or (3) it is more\n\nlikely than not that the dangerous condition had existed long enough to give the\n\npremises owner a reasonable opportunity to discover it. Wal\u2013Mart Stores, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                          10\n\fReece, 81 S.W.3d 812, 814 (Tex. 2002). The \u201cactual knowledge\u201d required for\n\npremises liability is of the dangerous condition at the time of the incident. City of\n\nDallas v. Thompson, 210 S.W.3d 601, 603 (Tex. 2006). \u201cConstructive knowledge\n\nis a substitute in the law for actual knowledge.\u201d CMH Homes, 15 S.W.3d at 102.\n\nConstructive knowledge is \u201cwhat a person after a reasonable inspection ought to\n\nknow or have reason to know.\u201d Mendia v. Fiesta Mart, L.L.C., No. 01-19-00018-\n\nCV, 2021 WL 3412175, at *4\u20135 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 5, 2021, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.). Reyes did not present any summary judgment evidence showing\n\nthat a Fiesta employee placed the substance on the floor. Therefore, she was required\n\nto present evidence that Fiesta had either actual or constructive knowledge of the\n\npremises condition. We first consider whether Reyes presented more than a scintilla\n\nof evidence that Fiesta had actual knowledge.\n\n      1.     Actual Knowledge\n\n      In its summary judgment motion, Fiesta asserted that Reyes had presented no\n\nevidence that it had actual knowledge of the substance on the floor prior to her fall.\n\nIt pointed to Reyes\u2019s deposition testimony and admission that she was not aware of\n\nany Fiesta employee who knew there was a substance on the floor prior to her fall\n\nor who knew the source of the substance. It further asserted that there was no\n\nevidence that the Fiesta employee whom Reyes testified was placing produce on a\n\ndisplay nearby or any other Fiesta employee knew there was a substance on the floor\n\n\n                                         11\n\fprior to Reyes\u2019s fall.3 Fiesta also pointed to Reyes\u2019s admission that she had no\n\nevidence that Fiesta knew about the substance on the floor prior to her fall:\n\n      REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 22: Admit that [y]ou have no\n      evidence that Fiesta had actual knowledge that the alleged substance\n      was present on the floor before your fall.\n\n             RESPONSE: ADMIT.\n\n      In her supplemental summary judgment response, as on appeal, Reyes\n\nasserted that the evidence showed that Fiesta had actual knowledge that the floor\n\nwas wet. She pointed to Fiesta\u2019s original interrogatory response stating \u201c[Reyes]\n\nignored a wet floor sign and proceeded through an area where a produce clerk was\n\ncleaning the floor, causing her[] to slip and fall.\u201d Reyes asserted that Fiesta amended\n\nits interrogatory response more than a year later to state that a cone was placed in\n\nthe area after Fiesta was notified of Reyes\u2019s fall and while an employee began\n\ncleaning the general department. According to Reyes, Fiesta amended its response\n\n\u201conly to match\u201d the assertion in its summary judgment motion that it had no\n\nknowledge of the substance on the floor.\n\n      Fiesta responded that it had minimal information regarding the facts\n\nsurrounding the fall when it first responded to Reyes\u2019s suit. According to Fiesta, it\n\namended its discovery responses once it learned from Amaro, the Fiesta store\n\n\n3\n      In her deposition, Reyes testified that the cart used by the Fiesta employee who\n      appeared to be \u201ccleaning\u201d the produce before placing it out on display was not a\n      mopping or janitorial-type cart but rather a regular shopping cart.\n\n                                           12\n\fmanager, that the warning cone had, in fact, been placed in the general area while an\n\nemployee was cleaning the entire area as a precaution after Fiesta became aware of\n\nthe fall. Fiesta correctly points out that it had a duty to amend or supplement its\n\nwritten discovery responses upon obtaining this additional information.4 Notably,\n\nFiesta\u2019s amended discovery responses are consistent with Reyes\u2019s own admission as\n\nwell as her deposition and affidavit testimony that there were no warning cones or\n\nwet floor signs in the area when she fell.\n\n      Reyes cites Coffee v. F.W. Woolworth Co. to argue that Fiesta\u2019s actual\n\nknowledge could be inferred from the fact that a store employee was placing produce\n\non a display nearby. 536 S.W.2d 539 (Tex. 1976). In Coffee, the plaintiff was\n\ninjured when she tripped over an empty display pallet on the floor of a Woolworth\n\nstore used to hold merchandise. See id. at 540. The jury found that Woolworth had\n\ncreated the dangerous condition and knew or should have known of it. Id. The court\n\nof appeals reversed, finding that the record contained no direct evidence that\n\nWoolworth had actual knowledge that the display pallet was empty. Coffee v. F.W.\n\nWoolworth Co., 526 S.W.2d 793, 795 (Tex. Civ. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg\n\n1975), rev\u2019d, 536 S.W.2d at 539. The Texas Supreme Court disagreed with the court\n\n\n\n4\n      See TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.5 (stating party must amend or supplement written\n      discovery if it \u201clearns that the party\u2019s response to written discovery was incomplete\n      or incorrect when made, or, although complete and correct when made, is no longer\n      complete and correct\u201d).\n\n                                             13\n\fof appeals, reasoning that the jury could have found that Woolworth had actual\n\nknowledge of the dangerous condition because store employees were actually\n\nworking on the display stand in question thereby creating the dangerous condition.\n\nSee 536 S.W.2d at 540\u201341. Here, by contrast, there is no evidence that a Fiesta\n\nemployee created the condition that caused Reyes to fall. And while Reyes testified\n\nthat a Fiesta employee was nearby stocking fruit from a cart onto a display shelf at\n\nthe time she fell, Reyes does not claim that she fell on the fruit. Coffee does not\n\nsupport Reyes\u2019s actual knowledge argument.\n\n      No evidence established that Fiesta actually knew of the substance on the\n\nfloor. Thus, we conclude that Reyes failed to meet her burden of producing a\n\nscintilla of evidence showing actual knowledge of the condition.\n\n      2.    Constructive Knowledge\n\n      We next consider whether Reyes presented more than a scintilla of evidence\n\nthat Fiesta had constructive knowledge of the substance on the floor. Courts analyze\n\nthe combination of proximity, conspicuity, and longevity of the dangerous condition\n\nin determining whether to attribute constructive knowledge. Wal\u2013Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nv. Spates, 186 S.W.3d 566, 567\u201368 (Tex. 2006).\n\n      Temporal evidence, i.e., evidence of the length of time the dangerous\n\ncondition existed, is the best indication of whether the premises owner had a\n\nreasonable opportunity to discover and remedy the condition. Reece, 81 S.W.3d at\n\n\n                                        14\n\f816. \u201cAn employee\u2019s proximity to a hazard, with no evidence indicating how long\n\nthe hazard was there, merely indicates that it was possible for the premises owner to\n\ndiscover the condition, not that the premises owner reasonably should have\n\ndiscovered it.\u201d Id. Temporal evidence is necessary for the factfinder to reasonably\n\nassess the opportunity that the premises owner had to discover the condition. Id. A\n\nreasonable time for the owner to discover the condition varies depending upon the\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case, and evidence of an employee\u2019s proximity to\n\nthe hazard \u201cwill often be relevant to the analysis.\u201d Id. For example, if a dangerous\n\ncondition is conspicuous, or an employee was in close proximity to a less\n\nconspicuous hazard for a \u201ccontinuous and significant period of time,\u201d an employee\u2019s\n\nproximity might shorten the time period in which the factfinder could find that the\n\npremises owner should have reasonably discovered the condition. Id. However,\n\nevidence of close proximity and conspicuousness of a condition are insufficient,\n\nalone, to prove constructive knowledge; temporal evidence \u201cof how long the hazard\n\nwas there\u201d is required. Id.\n\n      Reyes presented no evidence of how long the substance had been on the floor\n\nbefore she fell. In her deposition testimony and discovery responses, Reyes stated\n\nthat she did not know how long the substance had been on the floor prior to her fall,\n\nand she was not aware of anyone who knew how long the substance had been on the\n\nfloor before she fell. Reyes further stated that she did not know the last time the area\n\n\n                                          15\n\fhad been inspected prior to her fall nor was she aware of any statement by a Fiesta\n\nemployee indicating when the area had last been inspected. See Coburn v. Toys \u201cR\u201d\n\nUs-Del., Inc., No. 01-09-00871-CV, 2011 WL 345936, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] Feb. 3, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding plaintiff failed to present fact\n\nissue as to constructive knowledge because plaintiff presented no evidence of how\n\nlong substance was on the floor before she fell, no evidence that store employee saw\n\nspill before fall, and no evidence that substance was there when employee made her\n\nstore rounds about fifteen to twenty minutes before plaintiff fell). Reyes also\n\nadmitted that she had no evidence showing that Fiesta had constructive knowledge\n\nof the substance on the floor prior to her fall:\n\n      REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 22: Admit that [y]ou have no\n      evidence that Fiesta had constructive knowledge that the alleged\n      [s]ubstance was present on the floor before [y]our fall.\n\n             A: ADMIT.\n\n      We conclude that Reyes did not meet her burden to produce a scintilla of\n\nevidence showing that Fiesta had constructive knowledge of the condition. We\n\ntherefore hold that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof Fiesta on Reyes\u2019s premises liability claim against it.\n\n      We overrule Reyes\u2019s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f                          Adequate Time for Discovery\n\n      In her second issue, Reyes contends that the trial court erred in granting\n\nFiesta\u2019s no-evidence motion for summary judgment because she did not have\n\nadequate time for discovery and thus the motion was premature.\n\n      A party may move for a no-evidence summary judgment only \u201c[a]fter\n\nadequate time for discovery.\u201d TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). The rule does not require that\n\ndiscovery must have been completed, only that there was \u201cadequate time.\u201d Specialty\n\nRetailers, Inc. v. Fuqua, 29 S.W.3d 140, 145 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2000, pet. denied). In determining whether the trial court has permitted an adequate\n\ntime for discovery, we generally consider the following non-exclusive factors: (1)\n\nthe nature of the cause of action; (2) the nature of the evidence necessary to\n\ncontrovert the no-evidence motion; (3) the length of time the case has been active in\n\nthe trial court; (4) the amount of time the no-evidence motion has been on file; (5)\n\nwhether the movant has requested stricter time deadlines for discovery; (6) the\n\namount of discovery that has already taken place; and (7) whether the discovery\n\ndeadlines that are in place are specific or vague. Mendia, 2021 WL 3412175, at *6.\n\nA.    Nature of Case and Evidence Necessary to Controvert Motion\n\n      Reyes alleged that she slipped and fell on a substance on the floor of a Fiesta\n\ngrocery store. The case involves two parties and concerns the threshold issue of\n\nwhether Fiesta had actual or constructive knowledge of an unreasonably dangerous\n\n\n                                         17\n\fcondition on the premises. This case is not of a nature that would require extensive\n\nor complex discovery. See McClure v. Attebury, 20 S.W.3d 722, 729 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAmarillo 1999, no pet.).\n\n      As to the nature of the evidence necessary to controvert Fiesta\u2019s no-evidence\n\nmotion, Reyes asserts that she was unable to obtain a videotape surveillance\n\nrecording of her fall. According to Reyes, the Fiesta store manager told her sister\n\nthat the entire incident had been captured by the store\u2019s videotape surveillance\n\ncamera but Fiesta refused to produce the videotape recording in discovery and later\n\nstated that it did not have a recording of the incident.\n\n      The record does not support Reyes\u2019s assertion. In her deposition, Reyes\n\ntestified that the Fiesta store manager told her sister that he would review the nearby\n\nvideotape surveillance camera to see what had occurred. In his sworn declaration,\n\nthe store manager stated that he had reviewed the recording from the store\u2019s nearest\n\nvideotape surveillance camera and determined that the camera had not captured the\n\nfall or the incident area, and therefore there was no videotape recording of the\n\nincident.\n\nB.    Length of Time Case and Motion on File\n\n      Reyes filed suit against Fiesta on March 3, 2022. On January 27, 2023, the\n\ntrial court granted Fiesta\u2019s agreed motion for continuance extending all deadlines by\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f180 days.5 The case had been active for approximately fourteen months when Fiesta\n\nfiled its summary judgment motion on May 8, 2023. The summary judgment\n\nhearing on Fiesta\u2019s motion that was held on June 12, 2023 was continued to July 17,\n\n2023, allowing the parties an additional month of discovery. The trial court granted\n\nFiesta\u2019s summary judgment motion on July 17, 2023. Fiesta\u2019s no-evidence motion\n\nhad been on file more than two months at the time of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Courts\n\nhave held that shorter periods of time provided an adequate time for discovery. See,\n\ne.g., Gomes v. Casey, No. 02-22-00003-CV, 2022 WL 3464611, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nFort Worth Aug. 18, 2022, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding plaintiff had had adequate\n\ntime for discovery because defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion had been filed\n\nmore than six months after commencement of lawsuit and had been on file for\n\ntwenty-seven additional days before it was granted); Barton Food Mart, Inc. v.\n\nBotrie, No. 03-17-00292-CV, 2018 WL 5289538, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin Oct. 25,\n\n2018, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (concluding adequate time for discovery had passed\n\nwhere case had been on file for thirteen months when summary judgment motion\n\nwas filed and trial court granted motion in part following month); Rest. Teams Int\u2019l,\n\nInc. v. MG Secs. Corp., 95 S.W.3d 336, 340 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2002, no pet.)\n\n(finding adequate time for discovery had passed where case had been on file for\n\n\n5\n      The record does not contain the trial court\u2019s May 11, 2022 scheduling and docket\n      control order. According to the parties, the order granting the continuance extended\n      the discovery and dispositive motion deadlines to August 4, 2023.\n\n                                           19\n\fseven months at time motion was filed and motion had been on file for twenty-six\n\ndays before it was granted).\n\nC.    Amount of Discovery and Deadlines\n\n      We also consider the amount of discovery that took place, whether Fiesta\n\nrequested stricter deadlines for discovery, and whether the discovery deadlines that\n\nwere in place were specific or vague.\n\n      The parties had propounded and responded to discovery and Reyes\u2019s\n\ndeposition had been taken at the time Fiesta filed its summary judgment motion.\n\nReyes complains that Fiesta requested several extensions of the written discovery\n\ndeadlines, but the record does not show that Fiesta\u2019s requests for extensions or that\n\nsubsequent written responses and objections were opposed or untimely. Reyes also\n\nasserts that she emailed Fiesta\u2019s counsel in June and October 2022 to discuss\n\nscheduling depositions but received no response. The emails are not included in the\n\nrecord. The record shows that Fiesta provided the names of its two employees\n\ninvolved in the investigation of the fall\u2014the employee who first responded and the\n\nstore manager to whom Reyes referred in her deposition\u2014on May 2, 2022, when its\n\ninitial disclosures were served. Thus, Reyes had more than a year to request their\n\ndepositions prior to the filing of summary judgment but the record is void of\n\nevidence showing that she did. Further, the record does not show that Reyes\n\nrequested or attempted to notice any depositions between the original June 12, 2023\n\n\n                                         20\n\fsummary judgment hearing and the filing of her supplemental summary judgment\n\nresponse on July 10, 2023.\n\n      Fiesta did not request stricter discovery deadlines. Rather, it sought a 180-day\n\nextension of all deadlines which the trial court granted. Finally, the discovery\n\ndeadlines in this case were specific. The trial court ordered that \u201cthe deadlines set\n\nforth in the Scheduling and Docket Control Order dated May 11, 2022 and\n\npreviously entered in this case be extended by 180 days.\u201d\n\n      Under these circumstances, we hold that Reyes failed to show that the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting the no-evidence summary judgment because she did not have\n\nan adequate time for discovery.\n\nD.    Spoliation\n\n      In a sub-issue, Reyes asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment because Fiesta spoliated evidence.\n\n      1.     Applicable Law\n\n      Spoliation of evidence occurs when a party (1) deliberately destroys or fails\n\nto preserve relevant evidence or (2) when it fails to produce relevant evidence or to\n\nexplain its non-production. Wal\u2013Mart Stores, Inc. v. Johnson, 106 S.W.3d 718, 721\n\n(Tex. 2003). Under the first scenario, a party who deliberately destroys evidence \u201cis\n\npresumed to have done so because the evidence was unfavorable to its case.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fUnder the second scenario, \u201cthe presumption arises because the party controlling the\n\nmissing evidence cannot explain its failure to produce it.\u201d Id. at 722.\n\n      Whether a party has engaged in spoliation of evidence is a preliminary\n\nevidentiary question for the court and not for a jury. Brookshire Bros., Ltd. v.\n\nAldridge, 438 S.W.3d 9, 20 (Tex. 2014). The \u201cspoliation analysis involves a\n\ntwo-step judicial process: (1) the trial court must determine, as a question of law,\n\nwhether a party spoliated evidence, and (2) if spoliation occurred, the court must\n\nassess an appropriate remedy.\u201d Id. at 14. To find that a party spoliated evidence,\n\n\u201cthe court must find that (1) the spoliating party had a duty to reasonably preserve\n\nevidence, and (2) the party intentionally or negligently breached that duty by failing\n\nto do so.\u201d Id.\n\n      The doctrine of spoliation can apply in the summary judgment context. See\n\nClark v. Randalls Food, 317 S.W.3d 351, 356 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2010,\n\npet. denied). If a trial court concludes that the movant in a motion for summary\n\njudgment engaged in spoliation of evidence, the court may, but is not required to,\n\ndraw an inference that the evidence would have been favorable to the non-movant.\n\nAdobe Land Corp. v. Griffin, L.L.C., 236 S.W.3d 351, 356 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth\n\n2007, pet. denied). When a trial court grants summary judgment against a party\n\narguing spoliation, it is implied that the trial court denied the request for a spoliation\n\npresumption. See id. at 356\u201357 (presuming trial court considered and rejected\n\n\n                                           22\n\fplaintiffs\u2019 request for spoliation presumption where plaintiffs raised issue of\n\nentitlement to presumption in response to defendant\u2019s no-evidence summary\n\njudgment motion and trial court nonetheless granted no-evidence motion). A ruling\n\ndenying a spoliation request is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. at 357. Because\n\nReyes argued that Fiesta\u2019s summary judgment motion should be denied because it\n\nspoliated evidence crucial to her claim, and the trial court nevertheless granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Fiesta, we presume the trial court considered and\n\nrejected Reyes\u2019s spoliation request. See id. at 356\u201357.\n\n      2.     Breach of Duty\n\n      To determine whether Reyes was entitled to a spoliation presumption, we\n\nconsider whether (1) there was a duty to preserve evidence, (2) the alleged spoliator\n\nbreached that duty, and (3) the spoliation prejudiced the non-spoliator\u2019s ability to\n\npresent its case or defense. Clark, 317 S.W.3d at 356. The duty to preserve evidence\n\n\u201carises only when a party knows or reasonably should know that there is a substantial\n\nchance that a claim will be filed and that evidence in its possession or control will\n\nbe material and relevant to that claim.\u201d Brookshire Bros., 438 S.W.3d at 20. A duty\n\nto preserve evidence arises when a reasonable person would conclude from the\n\nseverity of an accident or other circumstances that a substantial chance of litigation\n\nexists. See In re Advanced Powder Sols., Inc., 496 S.W.3d 838, 854 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2016, no pet.). Further, \u201c[a] party must preserve what it knows\n\n\n                                         23\n\for reasonably should know is relevant in the action, is reasonably calculated to lead\n\nto the discovery of admissible evidence, is reasonably likely to be requested during\n\ndiscovery, or is the subject of a pending discovery sanction.\u201d Clark, 317 S.W.3d at\n\n357. The party alleging spoliation bears the burden of establishing the alleged\n\nspoliator had a duty to preserve the evidence in question and breached that duty. See\n\nBrookshire Bros., 438 S.W.3d at 20.\n\n      Assuming without deciding that Fiesta had a duty to preserve any existing\n\nvideotape surveillance recording of the incident, Reyes did not establish that Fiesta\n\nbreached its duty. An alleged spoliator can defend against an assertion of negligent\n\nor intentional destruction by providing other explanations to justify its failure to\n\npreserve evidence. Clark, 317 S.W.3d at 358; Adobe Land Corp., 236 S.W.3d at\n\n359. Here, Amaro, the Fiesta store manager, stated in his sworn declaration that\n\nupon reviewing the videotape surveillance recording from the closest store camera,\n\nhe determined that the camera did not capture the incident or the incident area.\n\nReyes failed to meet her burden to establish that Fiesta intentionally or negligently\n\nbreached its duty to preserve a videotape surveillance recording of the incident\n\nbecause such a recording did not exist. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to grant a spoliation presumption in Reyes\u2019s favor.\n\n      We overrule Reyes\u2019s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                   Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Kristin Guiney\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Adams and Justices Gunn and Guiney.\n\n\n\n\n                                        25",

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251         Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v.

Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway.

We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614. But four years later, Congress enacted CAFA, and with it the provision for review\n\n        codified at \u00a7 1453(c). Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L.

We need not resolve the matter in this case because\n        Defendants did not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u2014which was filed within thirty days of\n        removal, as calculated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C)\u2014was untimely.\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        4, 12\u201313 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)). So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

That being so, we have no need to review their\n\n        petitions for permission to appeal, and we dismiss those petitions as unnecessary.\n\n                                                       III.\n\n               Having satisfied ourselves of our appellate jurisdiction, we turn to the merits and\n\n        consider whether the district court erred when it held that it was required to remand the\n\n        case to state court pursuant to CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception.

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

But we have\n\n        not specified the standard by which the party seeking remand must carry its burden to show\n\n        that an exception applies. 10 E.g., Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u201336; Bartels ex rel.\n\n        Bartels v.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v. Chesapeake Operating, LLC, 718 F. App\u2019x 736, 739 n.3 (10th Cir.\n\n        2018) (quoting Dutcher, 840 F.3d at 1190).\n\n                We agree. CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n        (\u201cAbsent specific language in the statute specifying a different evidentiary standard, we\n\n        employ [for purposes of the local-controversy exception] the time-honored standard\n\n        routinely applied to the fundamental question of citizenship: proof by a preponderance of\n\n        the evidence.\u201d).\n\n               We therefore join our peer circuits in concluding that parties seeking remand must\n\n        show that a CAFA exception applies by a preponderance of the evidence. 12\n\n\n               12\n                  We recognize that, where no evidence has been submitted and the matter is to be\n        decided solely on the pleadings\u2014as with the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d element discussed\n        below, see infra Part III.C\u2014the language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is an ill fit.\n        For this reason, in the related context of the removing party\u2019s burden to establish CAFA\n        jurisdiction in the first place, the First Circuit has instead used the language of \u201creasonable\n        probability,\u201d while emphasizing that the standard is \u201cfor all practical purposes identical to\n        the preponderance standard adopted by several circuits.\u201d Amoche v. Guarantee Tr. Life Ins.\n\n\n                                                      22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 23 of 42\n\n\n\n\n                                                      B.\n\n               The first element of the local-controversy exception that Plaintiffs must establish by\n\n        a preponderance of the evidence is that \u201cgreater than two-thirds of the members of all\n\n        proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of\u201d Maryland. 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(I). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not carried their burden on this\n\n\n\n\n        Co., 556 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cThere was no error in the district court\u2019s discussion\n        of [the defendant]\u2019s burden in terms of the preponderance of the evidence. Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251        Doc: 88        Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property.

She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v.

The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v.

See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state.

See S.\n        Rep.

See\n\n        Mason, 842 F.3d at 390\u201391.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Wal-Mart\n\n        Puerto Rico, Inc., 121 F.4th 228 (1st Cir. 2024) (per curiam), is instructive. Kress Stores\n\n        noted that the circuits \u201chave largely followed the . . .

Co., 561 F.3d 144, 156 (3d Cir. 2009)); see id.\n\n        at 239 n.6 (collecting cases). As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17. But we agree with the First Circuit\u2019s rejection of that analysis in Kress\n\n        Stores, where it held that \u201cCAFA\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018a significant basis\u2019 requires a\n\n        comparative analysis to determine whether the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is \u2018an\n\n        important ground for the asserted claims in view of the alleged conduct of all the\n\n\n                                                      36\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 37 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Defendants.\u2019 But it does not follow that the test must be superlative, as the requirement of\n\n        a plus-factor would have it.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at\n\n        157). Such an interpretation \u201cwould rewrite \u2018a significant basis\u2019 in the statute into \u2018the most\n\n        significant basis.\u2019\u201d Id.; accord Walsh v. Defs., Inc., 894 F.3d 583, 592 (3d Cir. 2018)\n\n        (\u201c[T]he local controversy exception does not require that the local defendant\u2019s conduct be\n\n        the most significant conduct or that it predominates over claims against other defendants.\u201d).\n\n               Notably, in describing another exception (the home-state exception), CAFA uses a\n\n        different term absent from the local-controversy exception: it refers to \u201cthe primary\n\n        defendants.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(B) (emphasis added). While not an absolute rule,\n\n        there is a \u201cgenerally useful . . . interpretive principle\u201d of statutory construction that \u201c[i]n a\n\n        given statute, the same term usually has the same meaning and different terms usually have\n\n        different meanings.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 149 (2024). Because the local-\n\n        controversy exception requires only that the local defendant be \u201csignificant,\u201d while the\n\n        home-state exception refers to \u201cthe primary defendants,\u201d a review of the statute as a whole\n\n        supports that the local-controversy does not require that the local defendant be\n\n        superlatively \u201cprimary,\u201d but merely \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n               Our interpretation is also supported by the CAFA Senate Report, \u201cwhich contains\n\n        the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s views with respect to CAFA jurisdiction,\u201d and on which\n\n        \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court and our Court have heretofore had occasion to rely.\u201d Dominion\n\n        Energy, 928 F.3d at 336 n.11 (collecting cases). The Report states that \u201cthere must be at\n\n        least one real local defendant. By that, the Committee intends that the local defendant must\n\n        be a primary focus of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u2014not just a peripheral defendant. The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf.

By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient.

Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting.

Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement.

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250         Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,\n        867, 872 (1994); and then quoting Campbell-McCormick, Inc. v. Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway. Accord\n\n        Cheapside Mins., Ltd. v. Devon Energy Prod. Co., 94 F.4th 492, 496 (5th Cir. 2024)\n\n        (\u201c[Section] 1447(d) does not trump \u00a7 1291 to deny appeal of a remand order based on the\n\n        local controversy exception[.]\u201d); Simring, 29 F.4th at 1265\u201366 (11th Cir.); Jacks v.\n\n        Meridian Res. Co., 701 F.3d 1224, 1229 (8th Cir. 2012), abrogated in part on other\n\n        grounds by BP P.L.C. v. Mayor of Balt., 593 U.S. 230 (2021); 16 Wright & Miller\u2019s Federal\n\n        Practice & Procedure \u00a7 3931.2 (3d ed. 2012 & Supp. 2025).\n\n                                                     C.\n\n               That leaves the question of whether \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeal\n\n        here, precluding Defendants from utilizing \u00a7 1291 even though they otherwise would be\n\n        entitled to do so. We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614. But four years later, Congress enacted CAFA, and with it the provision for review\n\n        codified at \u00a7 1453(c). Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, \u00a7 5, 119 Stat.\n\n\n        \u201creasonable time\u201d rule for remand motions where \u00a7 1447(c) does not apply. Watson, 821\n        F.3d at 640 (collecting cases). We need not resolve the matter in this case because\n        Defendants did not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u2014which was filed within thirty days of\n        removal, as calculated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C)\u2014was untimely.\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        4, 12\u201313 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)). So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2. This Court, along with all other circuits to have considered the issue, has adopted\n        the latter interpretation. Scott, 865 F.3d at 193 n.2; accord Romulus v.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

But we have\n\n        not specified the standard by which the party seeking remand must carry its burden to show\n\n        that an exception applies. 10 E.g., Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u201336; Bartels ex rel.\n\n        Bartels v.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v.

CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v.

Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250        Doc: 88        Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property. J.A. 101. She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 776 n.10 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting general principle that\n        \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view\u201d (quoting United States v.

She counted businesses as citizens only if they\n\n        were \u201ceither organized under Maryland law or had [their] principal place of business in\n\n        Maryland.\u201d Id. The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v. Express Check\n\n        Advance of SC LLC, 591 F.3d 698, 701\u201305 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1),\n\n        (d)(10)). This is the exact definition Greeley averred she used in searching the business-\n\n        entity class members on Maryland\u2019s websites. See J.A. 101 (\u201cIf a 4000 Foot Property owner\n\n\n               14\n                  CAFA thus alters the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d for diversity jurisdiction, under which \u201ca\n        limited liability company\u2019s \u2018citizenship is that of its members.\u2019\u201d Ferrell v.

Certainly, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s\n\n        implicit conclusion that this definition satisfied Plaintiffs\u2019 preponderance-based burden.\n\n                                                      2.\n\n               That leaves the more complicated question of the individual property owners. While\n\n        CAFA defines the term \u201ccitizen\u201d for corporations and unincorporated associations, it\n\n        provides no definition for individuals. We therefore will presume, for purposes of this\n\n\n                                                      26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250        Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025       Pg: 27 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        analysis, that \u201ccitizen\u201d carries the same meaning for the local-controversy exception under\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A) as it does for diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a). See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state. Such a presumption\n\n        does not undermine CAFA\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d of \u201ckeep[ing] interstate actions in federal court and\n\n        truly intrastate actions in the state courts.\u201d 15 Adams, 958 F.3d at 1223 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n               15\n                  In fact, the CAFA Senate Report suggests that Congress anticipated that residency\n        alone could be enough to support application of the local-controversy exception.

We further note that some other circuits have signaled\n\n        openness to this line of reasoning. 16 See Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 571, 573\u201374 (5th Cir.)\n\n        (stating that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s place of residence . . . is prima facie proof of his\n\n        domicile\u201d and that \u201cwhere a proposed class is discrete in nature, a common sense\n\n        presumption should be utilized in determining whether citizenship requirements have been\n\n        met,\u201d and citing favorably a district court decision concluding that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 assertions\n\n        that they represented a class of individuals covered by homeowner\u2019s policies for homes\n\n\n               16\n                  We also recognize that some other circuits disagree.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

Because TTI is the only Maryland-citizen defendant,\n\n        Plaintiffs must satisfy this element as to TTI to be able to invoke the local-controversy\n\n        exception. We conclude that they have done so.\n\n\n                                                     33\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 34 of 42\n\n\n\n\n               This Court has only considered the meaning of the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d rule\n\n        once, in our 2013 opinion in Quicken Loans Inc. v. Alig, 737 F.3d 960. However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17.

The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157\n\n        (vacating district court decision where local defendant sold 13% of all policies in the state,\n\n        not because 13% was insufficient, but because not all policies sold necessarily violated the\n\n        law, and therefore the district court\u2019s calculation had not properly focused on the alleged\n\n        conduct). By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient. Lemy v. Direct\n\n        Gen. Fin. Co., 559 F. App\u2019x 796, 798 & n.1 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting. See Goldberg, 2024 WL 1050942, at *15 (district\n\n        court concluding that \u201cif Plaintiffs meet their burdens as to Counts I and II, TTI\u2019s liability\n\n        could meet (or exceed) that of Skyline\u201d).\n\n               The Ninth Circuit provided helpful analysis in a similar case, Allen v. Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356. We agree:\n\n        nothing in the statute indicates that, if there is even a single claim not asserted against the\n\n        local defendant, the local-controversy exception does not apply.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal\n\n        under \u00a7 1291. We dismiss Defendants\u2019 petitions for review under \u00a7 1453 as unnecessary.\n\n        And we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the local-controversy exception applies\n\n\n                                                      41\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 42 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        and that remand to the state court is required.\n\n                                                                 AFFIRMED; PETITIONS FOR\n                                                                       REVIEW DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42",
    "summary": "Here is a summary of the case in 3-5 sentences:\n\nThis case involves a lawsuit filed by a group of individuals (Respondents/Plaintiffs-Appellees) against two companies, Skyline Tower Painting, Inc. and Television Tower, Inc. (Petitioners/Defendants-Appellants), related to injuries allegedly caused by the companies' activities. The key legal issue appears to be related to workplace safety and potential negligence. The outcome of the case is that the appeals were affirmed, meaning the lower court's decision was upheld, but the specific details of the injuries and the lower court's decision are not provided in this document."

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141        Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v.

Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway.

We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614.

So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

That being so, we have no need to review their\n\n        petitions for permission to appeal, and we dismiss those petitions as unnecessary.\n\n                                                    III.\n\n               Having satisfied ourselves of our appellate jurisdiction, we turn to the merits and\n\n        consider whether the district court erred when it held that it was required to remand the\n\n        case to state court pursuant to CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception.

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

And we have held that the burden on the removing party is \u201cto prove [that] CAFA\n\n        jurisdiction exists by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d at 195. But we have\n\n        not specified the standard by which the party seeking remand must carry its burden to show\n\n        that an exception applies. 10 E.g., Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u201336; Bartels ex rel.\n\n        Bartels v.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v. Chesapeake Operating, LLC, 718 F. App\u2019x 736, 739 n.3 (10th Cir.\n\n        2018) (quoting Dutcher, 840 F.3d at 1190).\n\n                We agree. CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141       Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n        (\u201cAbsent specific language in the statute specifying a different evidentiary standard, we\n\n        employ [for purposes of the local-controversy exception] the time-honored standard\n\n        routinely applied to the fundamental question of citizenship: proof by a preponderance of\n\n        the evidence.\u201d).\n\n               We therefore join our peer circuits in concluding that parties seeking remand must\n\n        show that a CAFA exception applies by a preponderance of the evidence. 12\n\n\n               12\n                  We recognize that, where no evidence has been submitted and the matter is to be\n        decided solely on the pleadings\u2014as with the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d element discussed\n        below, see infra Part III.C\u2014the language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is an ill fit.\n        For this reason, in the related context of the removing party\u2019s burden to establish CAFA\n        jurisdiction in the first place, the First Circuit has instead used the language of \u201creasonable\n        probability,\u201d while emphasizing that the standard is \u201cfor all practical purposes identical to\n        the preponderance standard adopted by several circuits.\u201d Amoche v. Guarantee Tr. Life Ins.\n\n\n                                                      22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 23 of 42\n\n\n\n\n                                                      B.\n\n               The first element of the local-controversy exception that Plaintiffs must establish by\n\n        a preponderance of the evidence is that \u201cgreater than two-thirds of the members of all\n\n        proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of\u201d Maryland. 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(I). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not carried their burden on this\n\n\n\n\n        Co., 556 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cThere was no error in the district court\u2019s discussion\n        of [the defendant]\u2019s burden in terms of the preponderance of the evidence. Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property.

She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 776 n.10 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting general principle that\n        \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view\u201d (quoting United States v.

The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v.

See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state.

See\n\n        Mason, 842 F.3d at 390\u201391.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Wal-Mart\n\n        Puerto Rico, Inc., 121 F.4th 228 (1st Cir. 2024) (per curiam), is instructive. Kress Stores\n\n        noted that the circuits \u201chave largely followed the . . .

Co., 561 F.3d 144, 156 (3d Cir. 2009)); see id.\n\n        at 239 n.6 (collecting cases). As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17. But we agree with the First Circuit\u2019s rejection of that analysis in Kress\n\n        Stores, where it held that \u201cCAFA\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018a significant basis\u2019 requires a\n\n        comparative analysis to determine whether the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is \u2018an\n\n        important ground for the asserted claims in view of the alleged conduct of all the\n\n\n                                                      36\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141       Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 37 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Defendants.\u2019 But it does not follow that the test must be superlative, as the requirement of\n\n        a plus-factor would have it.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at\n\n        157). Such an interpretation \u201cwould rewrite \u2018a significant basis\u2019 in the statute into \u2018the most\n\n        significant basis.\u2019\u201d Id.; accord Walsh v. Defs., Inc., 894 F.3d 583, 592 (3d Cir. 2018)\n\n        (\u201c[T]he local controversy exception does not require that the local defendant\u2019s conduct be\n\n        the most significant conduct or that it predominates over claims against other defendants.\u201d).\n\n               Notably, in describing another exception (the home-state exception), CAFA uses a\n\n        different term absent from the local-controversy exception: it refers to \u201cthe primary\n\n        defendants.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(B) (emphasis added). While not an absolute rule,\n\n        there is a \u201cgenerally useful . . . interpretive principle\u201d of statutory construction that \u201c[i]n a\n\n        given statute, the same term usually has the same meaning and different terms usually have\n\n        different meanings.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 149 (2024). Because the local-\n\n        controversy exception requires only that the local defendant be \u201csignificant,\u201d while the\n\n        home-state exception refers to \u201cthe primary defendants,\u201d a review of the statute as a whole\n\n        supports that the local-controversy does not require that the local defendant be\n\n        superlatively \u201cprimary,\u201d but merely \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n               Our interpretation is also supported by the CAFA Senate Report, \u201cwhich contains\n\n        the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s views with respect to CAFA jurisdiction,\u201d and on which\n\n        \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court and our Court have heretofore had occasion to rely.\u201d Dominion\n\n        Energy, 928 F.3d at 336 n.11 (collecting cases). The Report states that \u201cthere must be at\n\n        least one real local defendant. By that, the Committee intends that the local defendant must\n\n        be a primary focus of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u2014not just a peripheral defendant. The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf.

By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient.

Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting.

Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356.

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142        Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,\n        867, 872 (1994); and then quoting Campbell-McCormick, Inc. v. Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway. Accord\n\n        Cheapside Mins., Ltd. v. Devon Energy Prod. Co., 94 F.4th 492, 496 (5th Cir. 2024)\n\n        (\u201c[Section] 1447(d) does not trump \u00a7 1291 to deny appeal of a remand order based on the\n\n        local controversy exception[.]\u201d); Simring, 29 F.4th at 1265\u201366 (11th Cir.); Jacks v.\n\n        Meridian Res.

Mayor of Balt., 593 U.S. 230 (2021); 16 Wright & Miller\u2019s Federal\n\n        Practice & Procedure \u00a7 3931.2 (3d ed. 2012 & Supp. 2025).\n\n                                                     C.\n\n               That leaves the question of whether \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeal\n\n        here, precluding Defendants from utilizing \u00a7 1291 even though they otherwise would be\n\n        entitled to do so. We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614. But four years later, Congress enacted CAFA, and with it the provision for review\n\n        codified at \u00a7 1453(c). Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, \u00a7 5, 119 Stat.\n\n\n        \u201creasonable time\u201d rule for remand motions where \u00a7 1447(c) does not apply. Watson, 821\n        F.3d at 640 (collecting cases). We need not resolve the matter in this case because\n        Defendants did not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u2014which was filed within thirty days of\n        removal, as calculated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C)\u2014was untimely.\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        4, 12\u201313 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)). So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v.

CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142       Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v.

Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property. J.A. 101. She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 776 n.10 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting general principle that\n        \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view\u201d (quoting United States v.

She counted businesses as citizens only if they\n\n        were \u201ceither organized under Maryland law or had [their] principal place of business in\n\n        Maryland.\u201d Id. The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v. Express Check\n\n        Advance of SC LLC, 591 F.3d 698, 701\u201305 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1),\n\n        (d)(10)). This is the exact definition Greeley averred she used in searching the business-\n\n        entity class members on Maryland\u2019s websites. See J.A. 101 (\u201cIf a 4000 Foot Property owner\n\n\n               14\n                  CAFA thus alters the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d for diversity jurisdiction, under which \u201ca\n        limited liability company\u2019s \u2018citizenship is that of its members.\u2019\u201d Ferrell v.

Certainly, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s\n\n        implicit conclusion that this definition satisfied Plaintiffs\u2019 preponderance-based burden.\n\n                                                      2.\n\n               That leaves the more complicated question of the individual property owners. While\n\n        CAFA defines the term \u201ccitizen\u201d for corporations and unincorporated associations, it\n\n        provides no definition for individuals. We therefore will presume, for purposes of this\n\n\n                                                      26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142        Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025       Pg: 27 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        analysis, that \u201ccitizen\u201d carries the same meaning for the local-controversy exception under\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A) as it does for diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a). See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state.

We further note that some other circuits have signaled\n\n        openness to this line of reasoning. 16 See Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 571, 573\u201374 (5th Cir.)\n\n        (stating that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s place of residence . . . is prima facie proof of his\n\n        domicile\u201d and that \u201cwhere a proposed class is discrete in nature, a common sense\n\n        presumption should be utilized in determining whether citizenship requirements have been\n\n        met,\u201d and citing favorably a district court decision concluding that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 assertions\n\n        that they represented a class of individuals covered by homeowner\u2019s policies for homes\n\n\n               16\n                  We also recognize that some other circuits disagree.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

Because TTI is the only Maryland-citizen defendant,\n\n        Plaintiffs must satisfy this element as to TTI to be able to invoke the local-controversy\n\n        exception. We conclude that they have done so.\n\n\n                                                     33\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 34 of 42\n\n\n\n\n               This Court has only considered the meaning of the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d rule\n\n        once, in our 2013 opinion in Quicken Loans Inc. v. Alig, 737 F.3d 960. However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17.

Because the local-\n\n        controversy exception requires only that the local defendant be \u201csignificant,\u201d while the\n\n        home-state exception refers to \u201cthe primary defendants,\u201d a review of the statute as a whole\n\n        supports that the local-controversy does not require that the local defendant be\n\n        superlatively \u201cprimary,\u201d but merely \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n               Our interpretation is also supported by the CAFA Senate Report, \u201cwhich contains\n\n        the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s views with respect to CAFA jurisdiction,\u201d and on which\n\n        \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court and our Court have heretofore had occasion to rely.\u201d Dominion\n\n        Energy, 928 F.3d at 336 n.11 (collecting cases).

The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157\n\n        (vacating district court decision where local defendant sold 13% of all policies in the state,\n\n        not because 13% was insufficient, but because not all policies sold necessarily violated the\n\n        law, and therefore the district court\u2019s calculation had not properly focused on the alleged\n\n        conduct). By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient. Lemy v. Direct\n\n        Gen. Fin. Co., 559 F. App\u2019x 796, 798 & n.1 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting. See Goldberg, 2024 WL 1050942, at *15 (district\n\n        court concluding that \u201cif Plaintiffs meet their burdens as to Counts I and II, TTI\u2019s liability\n\n        could meet (or exceed) that of Skyline\u201d).\n\n               The Ninth Circuit provided helpful analysis in a similar case, Allen v. Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356. We agree:\n\n        nothing in the statute indicates that, if there is even a single claim not asserted against the\n\n        local defendant, the local-controversy exception does not apply.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal\n\n        under \u00a7 1291. We dismiss Defendants\u2019 petitions for review under \u00a7 1453 as unnecessary.\n\n        And we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the local-controversy exception applies\n\n\n                                                      41\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 42 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        and that remand to the state court is required.\n\n                                                                AFFIRMED; PETITIONS FOR\n                                                                      REVIEW DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42",

BACKGROUND\n\n        The underlying lawsuit concerns the assignment of fourteen oil and gas leases\n\ncovering 633.22 acres in La Salle County. To effectuate the assignment, real party in\n\ninterest Texas Lone Star Petroleum Corporation (Lone Star) and Empresa Energy, LLC\n\n(Empresa)2 entered into two contracts: a \u201cPurchase and Sale Agreement\u201d (PSA) and a\n\n\u201cPartial Assignment of Oil, Gas, and Mineral Leases with Reservation of Overriding\n\nRoyalty Interest and Reversionary Rights\u201d (Assignment). The Assignment contains a\n\nvenue selection clause which provides that \u201c[v]enue for any cause of action pertaining to\n\nthis Assignment or the interests assigned or reserved by this Assignment shall lie\n\nexclusively in Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas.\u201d3\n\n        In the PSA, Lone Star agreed to assign the leases to Empresa, and Empresa\n\nagreed to pay Lone Star $850.00 per acre for 633.22 acres for the total sum of $538,237\n\n\n\n       2 Empresa has not answered or otherwise appeared in the underlying lawsuit or this original\n\nproceeding.\n        3 The PSA contains a similar venue selection clause which provides that \u201c[v]enue for any cause of\n\naction relating to this agreement or the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall lie exclusively\nin Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas.\u201d\n\n                                                     2\n\fas the purchase price. In the Assignment, Lone Star transferred its interests in the leases\n\nto Empresa \u201cfor ten dollars ([$]10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.\u201d The\n\nAssignment granted Lone Star contingent reversionary rights to the leases if, for instance,\n\nEmpresa failed to drill a well according to certain specifications on lease acreage, or if\n\nEmpresa\u2019s wells did not satisfy certain production levels. If such an instance occurred,\n\nthen Lone Star could terminate the Assignment, and Empresa was required to reassign\n\nits interests back to Lone Star.\n\n          Thereafter, Empresa assigned seven of the fourteen leases to Chesapeake\n\nExploration, which conveyed some interests to CNOOC. Chesapeake Operating then\n\nformed two pooled units that included portions of the leases and commenced drilling.\n\nLater, Chesapeake Exploration assigned its interests in the seven leases to INEOS.\n\nINEOS began drilling wells for itself and as operator for CNOOC, and Jamestown also\n\nbegan drilling wells.\n\n          On January 7, 2025, Lone Star filed suit against relators and Empresa in Nueces\n\nCounty alleging that the case involved a \u201cmajor transaction,\u201d and, thus, the venue\n\nselection clause in the Assignment provided for mandatory venue in Nueces County. See\n\nid. \u00a7 15.020. Lone Star alleged that some of the wells that had been drilled failed to satisfy\n\nthe production levels required by the Assignment, thereby triggering Lone Star\u2019s right to\n\ntake over the ownership and operation of the wells and associated proration units.\n\nAccordingly, Lone Star alleged that it possessed equitable title to the wells and acreage,\n\nand it sought, inter alia, specific performance of the Assignment to enforce its ownership\n\nrights.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       Subsequently, relators filed separate motions to transfer venue arguing that the\n\nvenue selection clause was unenforceable because the PSA and Assignment did not\n\ninvolve a \u201cmajor transaction,\u201d and that venue was mandatory in La Salle County where\n\nthe wells and proration units are located. Lone Star filed a response to the motions to\n\ntransfer venue, and in support of its response and position that the lawsuit involved a\n\nmajor transaction, presented the amended affidavit of Jeffrey D. Cobbs, the President of\n\nLone Star, who testified in relevant part that:\n\n       (a)    The [Assignment] was signed as part of and together with the PSA\n              and the [Assignment] and all obligations contained in the\n              [Assignment] are made part of the PSA. The PSA and [Assignment]\n              were parts of a single transaction for the purchase, sale[,] and\n              development of the Subject Leases.\n\n       (b)    The PSA required Empresa to pay [Lone Star] $538,237 cash, and\n              to agree to perform the obligations under the [Assignment], all of\n              which are part of the consideration paid for the PSA and the\n              [Assignment]. The dollar amount of [the consideration] paid under\n              the PSA was not stated in the [Assignment] because the parties did\n              not want to publicly disclose the commercial terms of the transaction\n              in a recorded document.\n\n       (c)    Article XVII of the [Assignment] contains an express obligation for\n              the Assignee to drill wells to the depths covered by the [Assignment],\n              that a reasonable and prudent operator would drill under the same\n              or similar circumstances. This provision obligated the Assignee to\n              drill one or more wells to the Eagle Ford formation. Chesapeake and\n              INEOS, as assignees of Empresa, did actually drill multiple wells to\n              the Eagle Ford formation, on the acreage covered by the\n              [Assignment].\n\n       (d)    The Assignee\u2019s obligation to drill such wells was an important part of\n              the \u201cother good and valuable consideration\u201d exchanged for the\n              [Assignment], and if Assignee had failed to drill such a well before\n              the leases terminate, the penalty was termination of Assignee\u2019s rights\n              and reassignment to [Lone Star]. Based on the PSA, the value of the\n              acreage that would be lost by the Assignee for failure to drill was at\n              least $538,474.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       (e)    On January 22, 2010, the date of the [Assignment], the cost to drill\n              and the value of an Eagle Ford well was far in excess of $1 million.\n              On the first well alone, the Broken Arrow Ranch Unit C LAS 2H Well,\n              Chesapeake\u2019s authority for expenditure was $11,311,600 . . . .\n\n       (f)    In June of the year 2010, [Empresa] sold and assigned seven (7) of\n              the Subject Leases to [Chesapeake Exploration]. Chesapeake later\n              bought seven (7) replacement leases covering lands that had\n              originally been part of the [Assignment]. The seven Subject Leases\n              and the replacement leases are all covered by the [Assignment].\n\n       (g)    But for the [Assignment], Chesapeake and INEOS would not have\n              drilled the C2H Well or expended the monetary amounts they did\n              drilling this and other wells. The expenditure of these well costs were\n              an important part of the value agreed to under the [Assignment].\n\n       (h)    The obligation to drill is stated in the [Assignment], and all parties\n              were aware of and agreed to this consideration at the time it was\n              signed in 2010. Its value to the parties was known and understood\n              by both [Lone Star] and by [Empresa.]\n\n       (i)    The penalty for Assignee\u2019s failure to drill an Eagle Ford well is\n              termination of the [Assignment] and reassigning the acreage to [Lone\n              Star]. The loss of this acreage would have the agreed value of\n              $538,237, as agreed in the PSA. The combined value of the initial\n              Purchase Price and the value of the lost acreage is $1,076,474.00.\n\n       (j)    The parties to the [Assignment] agreed and understood that the\n              Assignee would be required to expend the cost of drilling an Eagle\n              Ford Shale well, at a cost in excess of $1 million, or lose the purchase\n              price and the acreage value, for a combined value of $1,076,474.00.\n              In either event, the Assignee is obligated to expend more than $1\n              million as consideration for the transaction evidenced by the\n              [Assignment].\n\n       (k)    The [Assignment] contains a paragraph that requires venue of any\n              cause of action pertaining to the [Assignment] or any of the interests\n              assigned or reserved in the [Assignment to] lie exclusively in Nueces\n              County, Texas.\n\nRelators filed a reply to Lone Star\u2019s response, and they further filed objections to Cobb\u2019s\n\namended affidavit and a motion to exclude the amended affidavit. On April 30, 2025, the\n\ntrial court held a hearing on relator\u2019s motions to transfer venue and the related evidentiary\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fmatters. On May 9, 2025, the trial court signed orders denying relators\u2019 motions to transfer\n\nvenue, overruling their objections to Cobb\u2019s affidavit, and denying their motion to exclude\n\nCobb\u2019s affidavit.\n\n       This original proceeding ensued. By two issues, relators assert that: (1) Lone\n\nStar\u2019s action does not arise from a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d because its \u201caggregate stated\n\nvalue\u201d falls below the minimum required by \u00a7 15.020; and (2) venue is mandatory in La\n\nSalle County under \u00a7 15.011 because Lone Star asserts equitable and legal title to oil and\n\ngas wells and proration units located there. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 15.020, 15.011. We have requested\n\nand received a response to the petition for writ of mandamus from Lone Star and a reply\n\nthereto from relators. See TEX. R. APP. P. 52.4, 52.5, 52.8.\n\n                                     II.     MANDAMUS\n\n       A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available only when the trial court\n\nclearly abused its discretion and the party seeking relief lacks an adequate remedy on\n\nappeal. In re Ill. Nat\u2019l Ins., 685 S.W.3d 826, 834 (Tex. 2024) (orig. proceeding). \u201cThe relator\n\nbears the burden of proving these two requirements.\u201d In re H.E.B. Grocery Co., 492\n\nS.W.3d 300, 302 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam); Walker v. Packer, 827\n\nS.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding).\n\n       Generally, venue rulings may only be reviewed on appeal from the final judgment\n\nin the case. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.064(a) (prohibiting interlocutory\n\nappeals of venue determinations); TEX. R. CIV. P. 87.6 (same). However, mandamus relief\n\nis appropriate to enforce mandatory venue provisions. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 15.0642 (\u201cA party may apply for a writ of mandamus with an appellate court to\n\nenforce the mandatory venue provisions of this chapter.\u201d); Wagner v. Apache Corp., 627\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fS.W.3d 277, 288 (Tex. 2021) (stating that \u201cinterlocutory review of a trial court\u2019s failure to\n\nenforce a mandatory venue provision is available only through a writ of mandamus\u201d).\n\n                                       III.    VENUE\n\n       The plaintiff makes the initial choice of venue. Fortenberry v. Great Divide Ins., 664\n\nS.W.3d 807, 811 (Tex. 2023); In re Fox River Real Est. Holdings, Inc., 596 S.W.3d 759,\n\n762 (Tex. 2020) (orig. proceeding). A defendant may challenge a plaintiff\u2019s chosen venue\n\nby filing a motion to transfer. TEX. R. CIV. P. 86\u201387; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 15.063. If a defendant challenges the plaintiff\u2019s venue choice by filing a timely motion\n\nto transfer venue, the plaintiff then bears the burden to present prima facie proof that\n\nvenue is maintainable in the county of suit, while the defendant bears the burden to prove\n\nvenue is maintainable in the county to which the transfer is sought. Fortenberry, 664\n\nS.W.3d at 811; In re Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, 711 S.W.3d 732, 738 (Tex.

LONE STAR\u2019S VENUE CHOICE: \u00a7 15.020\n\n       In their first issue, relators assert that the venue-selection clause in the Assignment\n\nis not enforceable because the aggregate stated value of the transaction at issue is below\n\nthe million-dollar requirement contained in the \u201cmajor transaction\u201d venue provision. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020. In support of their contention, they contend\n\nthat the PSA reflects a payment of $538,237, and the Assignment reflects a payment of\n\n\u201cten dollars (10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.\u201d Lone Star argues, in\n\ncontrast, that the PSA and Assignment comprise a major transaction because, in addition\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fto these sums, the Assignment required the assignees to either drill a well at a cost of\n\nmore than $1 million or reassign the property at issue to Lone Star with a stipulated value\n\nof $538,237.\n\nA.    Applicable Law\n\n      Venue selection clauses are generally unenforceable unless the contract\n\nconstitutes a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d under \u00a7 15.020 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\nIn re Grp. 1 Realty, Inc., 441 S.W.3d 469, 472 (Tex.

Section 15.020 provides:\n\n      (a)      In this section, \u201cmajor transaction\u201d means a transaction evidenced by\n               a written agreement under which a person pays or receives, or is\n               obligated to pay or entitled to receive, consideration with an\n               aggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million.

App.\u2014Tyler June 29, 2018, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). In determining the\n\naggregate stated value of the consideration in the transaction, we may consider separate\n\ninstruments. See Rieder v. Woods, 603 S.W.3d 86, 94\u201395 (Tex. 2020) (summarizing the\n\nlaw regarding the analysis of instruments pertaining to the same transaction); SM Energy\n\nCo. v. Union Pac. R.R., 652 S.W.3d 830, 840 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2022, pet. denied)\n\n(considering a lease and wire transfer together to determine that the claim met the\n\naggregate stated value required by \u00a7 15.020); Hughes v. Pearcy, No. 03-10-00319-CV,\n\n2014 WL 7014353, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin Dec. 8, 2014, pet. denied) (mem. op)\n\n(concluding that a claim evidenced by four written agreements, construed together, did\n\nnot meet the aggregate stated value required by \u00a7 15.020).\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has addressed how to determine the \u201caggregate stated\n\nvalue\u201d of the consideration in an agreement for purposes of \u00a7 15.020. See In re Tex. Ass\u2019n\n\nof Sch. Bds., Inc., 169 S.W.3d 653, 657\u201360 (Tex. 2005) (orig. proceeding). In that case,\n\nthe supreme court considered a venue selection provision in an agreement wherein the\n\nrelators agreed to provide more than $17 million in risk coverage for a cost of $41,973.\n\nId. at 654. The parties disagreed regarding whether the aggregated stated value of the\n\nconsideration was determined by using the risk coverage amount, $17 million, or the\n\namount paid for the coverage, $41,973. Id. at 657. In deciding this issue, the supreme\n\ncourt considered that the risk coverage agreement was an aleatory contract, that is, \u201ca\n\ncontract in which a promise is conditioned on the happening of a fortuitous event, [or] an\n\nevent of chance.\u201d Id. at 658. The court explained that insurance premiums are a function\n\nof calculated risk, and once risk has attached the premiums have been earned and are\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fgenerally non-returnable. Id. at 659. Reasoning that \u201cthe consideration to be valued is the\n\nundertaking of the risk that insured losses might occur,\u201d the supreme court concluded that\n\n\u201c[t]he aggregate stated value of the consideration for the coverage agreement is the\n\namount of the contribution specified in the agreement for assumption of the risk of loss\n\nfrom the enumerated perils, not the coverage limits.\u201d Id. at 659. The supreme court thus\n\ndetermined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enforce the\n\ncontractual venue selection provision in the risk coverage agreement under \u00a7 15.020. Id.\n\nB.     Analysis\n\n       Relators assert that this case does not involve a major transaction because the\n\nvalue of the consideration stated in the PSA and Assignment combined is less than $1\n\nmillion. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020(a). In contrast, Lone Star\n\nexplains that:\n\n       Under the [Assignment], the Assignee had two choices: (a) drill an Eagle\n       Ford Shale well as required in Article XVII of the [Assignment] at a cost in\n       excess of $1 million; or (b) suffer the penalty for failure to drill under Article\n       V. Paragraph A of the [Assignment], which, combined with the original\n       purchase price set forth in the PSA, had a value of $1,076,474. In either\n       event, the Assignee would be obligated to expend a stated value in excess\n       of $1 million.\n\n       This Court must consider the value of the drilling commitment in the\n       [Assignment] together with the purchase price stated in the PSA. Such a\n       review unavoidably leads to the conclusion that the transaction underlying:\n       (a) the purchase price in the PSA; (b) the obligation to drill under the\n       [Assignment]; and (c) the value of the penalty for failure to drill, clearly\n       constitutes a single \u201cmajor transaction\u201d as provided in \u00a7 15.020. Under any\n       scenario, the value of consideration for this transaction exceeds the $1\n       million threshold under \u00a7 15.020(a), and thus the venue selection clause\n       would be applicable under \u00a7 15.020(b).\n\n(Record citations omitted). Lone Star thus alleges that we must extrapolate the amount\n\nof the consideration at issue based on the ramifications of the agreement, and it further\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fasserts that the trial court was entitled to consider Cobb\u2019s amended affidavit as extrinsic\n\nevidence in support of its valuation.\n\n       As stated previously, \u00a7 15.020 defines a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d subject to mandatory\n\nvenue in the county specified by agreement as \u201ca transaction evidenced by a written\n\nagreement under which a person pays or receives, or is obligated to pay or entitled to\n\nreceive, consideration with an aggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million.\u201d\n\nId. \u00a7 15.020(a). We determine the proper construction of this statute \u201cusing well-\n\nestablished statutory-construction principles and a plain-language approach. In re Fox\n\nRiver Real Est. Holdings, Inc., 596 S.W.3d at 763.\n\n       Based on the plain terms of the statute, the value of the consideration must be\n\nspecifically \u201cstated\u201d in the agreement. See id.; see also In re Togs Energy, Inc., No. 05-\n\n09-01018-CV, 2009 WL 3260910, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Oct. 13, 2009, orig.\n\nproceeding) (mem. op.) (\u201cUnder [\u00a7] 15.020(a), the parties\u2019 agreement must contain the\n\naggregate stated value of the consideration. Because the Settlement and Release\n\nAgreement does not contain this information, it fails to qualify as a \u2018major\u2019 transaction\n\nunder [\u00a7] 15.020.\u201d). Further, we do not consider contingent or prospective amounts in\n\ndetermining the aggregate stated value of the consideration. See In re Tex. Ass\u2019n of Sch.\n\nBds., Inc., 169 S.W.3d at 658\u201359; see also NGL Water Sols.

Lone\n\nStar asserts that in Group 1, the purchase price for certain option agreements was not\n\nstated in the agreement but was later determined by appraisal, yet \u201cthe court held that the\n\ntransaction in that case was governed by \u00a7 15.020, even though the dollar value was not\n\nexpressly \u2018stated\u2019 in the agreement.\u201d We disagree with Lone Star\u2019s characterization of\n\nGroup 1. In Group 1, the parties disagreed regarding which of two mandatory venue\n\nstatutes applied to the parties\u2019 dispute, and the court held that \u00a7 15.020 \u201cclearly controls.\u201d\n\nIn re Grp. 1 Realty, Inc., 441 S.W.3d at 473. In so ruling, the court noted that \u201c[n]either\n\nparty contests that the [agreement] constitutes a major transaction under [\u00a7] 15.020,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[a]s such, we need not decide the issue.\u201d Id. at 474 n.5.\n\n       Lone Star similarly asserts that In re Royalco supports its contention that the value\n\nof the consideration need not be stated in the agreement to support mandatory venue\n\nunder \u00a7 15.020. See generally In re Royalco Oil & Gas Corp., 287 S.W.3d 398. There,\n\nthe court considered whether a saltwater disposal lease agreement constituted a major\n\ntransaction. Id. at 399. That court considered that the lease had a 99-year fixed term and\n\nrequired monthly rental payments of $20,000, so \u201cthe lease would require the payment of\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f$1 million in rentals in less than five years.\u201d Id. at 400. The court thus concluded that \u201cthe\n\nlease constitutes a \u2018major transaction\u2019 for purposes of [\u00a7] 15.020 because it provides for\n\nthe payment of \u2018consideration with an aggregate stated value\u2019 of more than $1 million.\u201d\n\nId. at 400\u201301. Lonestar concedes; however, that \u201c[t]he court did the math\u201d in reaching its\n\nconclusion.\n\n       Here the PSA and Assignment do not provide for consideration with \u201can aggregate\n\nstated value equal to or greater than $1 million,\u201d and we cannot consider an uncertain,\n\nprospective cost (or loss) as part of consideration for the agreement. Accordingly,\n\n\u00a7 15.020 does not apply. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020(a), (b); In re\n\nTex. Ass\u2019n of Sch.

We reject Lone Star\u2019s contentions otherwise.\n\nC.     Summary\n\n       We conclude that Lone Star failed to meet its burden to show that its lawsuit was\n\nbased on a major transaction rendering venue mandatory in Nueces County. See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020. Accordingly, we sustain relators\u2019 first issue.\n\n                        V.     RELATORS\u2019 VENUE CHOICE: \u00a7 15.011\n\n       In their second issue, relators contend that venue should be transferred to La Salle\n\nCounty based on mandatory venue pertaining to land because Lone Star asserts\n\nequitable and legal title to oil and gas wells and proration units located there. See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.011. Lone Star asserts that \u00a7 15.020 regarding major\n\ntransactions takes precedence over \u00a7 15.011, see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f\u00a7 15.020(c); In re Fisher, 433 S.W.3d at 534, but does not otherwise contend that \u00a7 15.011\n\nis inapplicable. We have determined that \u00a7 15.020 does not supply mandatory venue, so\n\nwe proceed to determine if relators have met their burden to prove venue should be\n\ntransferred to La Salle County. See Fortenberry, 664 S.W.3d at 811; In re Sanofi-Aventis\n\nU.S. LLC, 711 S.W.3d at 738.\n\n       Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 15.011, entitled \u201cLand,\u201d provides that:\n\n       Actions for recovery of real property or an estate or interest in real property,\n       for partition of real property, to remove encumbrances from the title to real\n       property, for recovery of damages to real property, or to quiet title to real\n       property shall be brought in the county in which all or a part of the property\n       is located.\n\nTEX.

Two\n\nfacts must be established to show mandatory venue based on this provision: (1) the\n\nnature of the suit fits within those listed in \u00a7 15.011; and (2) all or part of the realty at issue\n\nis in the county. See In re Harding, 563 S.W.3d 366, 370\u201371 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2018,\n\norig. proceeding); Sustainable Tex. Oyster Res. Mgmt. L.L.C. v. Hannah Reef, Inc., 491\n\nS.W.3d 96, 107 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2016, pet. denied). It is undisputed that\n\nthe property at issue in this original proceeding is in La Salle County.\n\n       We examine the \u201cessence\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d of a dispute to determine whether it falls\n\nwithin \u00a7 15.011. See In re Applied Chem. Magnesias Corp., 206 S.W.3d 114, 119 (Tex.\n\n2006) (orig. proceeding) (\u201cessence\u201d); Yzaguirre v. KCS Res., Inc., 53 S.W.3d 368, 371\n\n(Tex. 2001) (\u201csubstance\u201d). We determine the essence or substance of a suit by examining\n\n\u201cthe facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, the rights asserted, and the relief sought.\u201d In re\n\nSignorelli Co., 446 S.W.3d 470, 474 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, orig.\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fproceeding). \u201c[O]nce it is demonstrated that the court\u2019s judgment would have some effect\n\non an interest in real property, the venue of the suit is properly fixed under [\u00a7] 15.011.\u201d In\n\nre Hardwick, 426 S.W.3d 151, 161 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, orig.\n\nproceeding). If \u00a7 15.011 applies to one of Lone Star\u2019s claims or causes of action, then all\n\n\u201cclaims or causes of action arising from the same transaction, occurrence, or series of\n\ntransactions or occurrences\u201d must be brought in the county of mandatory venue. TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.004; see In re Signorelli Co., 446 S.W.3d at 474; In re\n\nHardwick, 426 S.W.3d at 161.\n\n       In its original petition, Lone Star asserted that it was filing suit against relators for\n\ncauses of action concerning the Assignment. Lone Star stated that, under the\n\nAssignment, it had \u201ca preferential right to take over ownership and operation of all wells\n\nin the event certain conditions occur.\u201d Lone Star explained that the Assignment required\n\nthe assignee to produce two barrels of oil per day per well; that relators breached the\n\nAssignment by failing to meet this requirement; and that relators\u2019 failure triggered Lone\n\nStar\u2019s \u201ctake-over right.\u201d Among other forms of relief sought, Lone Star requested the trial\n\ncourt to award it \u201cownership and operation of the C-2H Well together with the oil and gas\n\nleases covering the proration unit of 440 acres\u201d and \u201cownership and operation of the D-\n\n5H Well together with the oil and gas leases covering the proration unit of 480 acres.\u201d In\n\nthe alternative, Lone Star requested the trial court to impose constructive trusts on\n\nrelators\u2019 interests in these properties.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Lone Star\u2019s lawsuit constitutes an action\n\nfor the recovery of an interest in real property under \u00a7 15.011. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 15.011; In re Applied Chem.

CONCLUSION\n\n       The Court, having examined and fully considered relators\u2019 petition for writ of\n\nmandamus, Lone Star\u2019s response, relators\u2019 reply, and the applicable law, is of the opinion\n\nthat relators have met their burden to obtain relief. Accordingly, we conditionally grant the\n\npetition for writ of mandamus. We direct the trial court to: (1) vacate its May 9, 2025 order\n\ndenying relators\u2019 motions to transfer venue; and (2) issue an order granting their motions.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fOur writ will issue only if the trial court fails to timely act in accordance with this\n\nmemorandum opinion.\n\n                                                            YSMAEL D.

    "summary": "Here is a summary of the case in 3-5 sentences:\n\nThe case involves a dispute over oil and gas leases in La Salle County, Texas. The parties had signed an agreement with a venue selection clause stating that any lawsuits related to the assignment of the leases would be heard in Nueces County, Texas. However, the defendants argued that this clause was unenforceable and that the lawsuit should be heard in La Salle County, where the property is located, citing Texas law on mandatory venue. The court conditionally granted the petition for writ of mandamus, which means the trial court's decision to keep the case in Nueces County was overturned.\n\n**Key legal issue:** Enforcement of a venue selection clause in a contract\n**Type of injury:** None (this is a dispute over the location of a lawsuit, not a personal injury case)\n**Outcome:** The court conditionally granted the petition for writ of mandamus, effectively transferring the case to La Salle County."

After purchasing the range, Plaintiffs\u2019 house tragically burned \n18  down.  Months later, after Plaintiffs received notice of a voluntary recall regarding the \n19  electric range, they suspected the product caused the fire and filed suit for products \n20  liability, negligence, and breach of warranty.  Because they brought action in state \n21  court, Plaintiffs completed a form complaint and attached just five sentences of factual \n22  allegations.  Defendants removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, \n23  and they now jointly move to dismiss all claims, arguing that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the \n24  federal pleading standard.

(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d).  (Notice of Removal at \n3  15, ECF No. 1.)   After Plaintiffs\u2019 house burned down in January 2024, Plaintiffs learned \n4  that their electric range was subject to a voluntary recall because the knobs could be \n5  activated through accidental contact.  (Id. at 16.)  Plaintiff filed a form complaint (\u201cthe \n6  Complaint\u201d), bringing causes of action for strict liability, negligence, and breach of \n7  warranty.  (Id. at 15.)  The only factual allegations that Plaintiffs provided were: \n8       On January 8, 2024 Samsung Model No. NE58K9850WS/AA, while being \n        used in a foreseeable manner as the primary range/stove in the kitchen \n9       of Plaintiffs\u2019 family home, located 15801 Horseless Carriage Drive, \n        Redding, CA 96001, started a fire. The fire destroyed the house and its \n10       contents and resulted in bodily injury to all Plaintiffs other than Neil \n        Liebick, who was away on a business trip. Plaintiff\u2019s [sic] purchased the \n11       product from Costco in or about 2023. After the fire, this model electric \n        range was subject to a voluntary product recall by Samsung because the \n12       front-mounted knobs can be activated through accidental contact by \n        people or pets. That defect caused this fire.                    \n13                                                                        \n   (Id. at 16.)

In the same vein, conclusory \n12  or formulaic recitations of elements alone do not suffice.  Id.  \u201cA claim has facial \n13  plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \n14  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id.   \n15                              DISCUSSION                                \n16  I.   Products Liability                                               \n17       A.   Stating a Claim                                             \n18       A plaintiff may recover for a products liability claim under a theory of strict \n19  liability or negligence.  Trejo v. Johnson & Johnson, 13 Cal. App. 5th 110, 125 (2017).  \n20  To succeed under either theory, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that the product was \n21  defective; and (2) that the defect existed when the product left the hands of the \n22  manufacturer.  Daly v. General Motors Corp., 20 Cal.3d 725, 758 n.1 (1978).  \n23  Additionally, a plaintiff must show \u201ca substantial probability that the design defect, \n24  and not something else, caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d  Stephen v. Ford Motor Co., 134 \n25  Cal. App. 4th 1363, 1373 (2005).                                      \n26       While Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Samsung issued a voluntary recall, they \n27  do not plead that their range in particular had any defect, or that a defect existed \n28  when it left Defendant Samsung.  Even if Plaintiffs satisfied these elements, they fall \n1  far short of plausibly stating that \u201cthe design defect, and not something else, caused\u201d \n2  their injury.  See id.  Plaintiffs summarily allege the defect \u201ccaused\u201d the fire, which is a \n3  legal conclusion that the Court is not bound to accept as true.  See Notice of Removal \n4  at 16; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Similarly, Plaintiffs plead that the electric range \u201cstarted \n5  a fire,\u201d but they provide no factual allegations supporting this conclusory allegation.  \n6  (See Notice of Removal at 16.)  The Complaint is devoid of any factual allegations \n7  showing that the electric range started the fire, much less that a fire was due to a \n8  defect.  As Defendants point out, the Complaint \u201csays nothing about how the fire \n9  began, whether the range was on, how it may have been activated, or how it was \n10  involved in the fire.\u201d  (See Reply at 3, ECF No. 17.)  Because Plaintiffs fail to \n11  adequately allege causation, this claim must be dismissed.            \n12       B.   Theory of Liability                                         \n13       \u201cUnder California law, there are three ways to hold a manufacturer strictly liable \n14  for injuries caused by its product: (1) if the product is defectively manufactured; (2) if \n15  it is defectively designed; or (3) if it is distributed without sufficient warnings or \n16  instructions about its potential for harm.\u201d  Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co., 140 Cal. App. \n17  4th 1202, 1208 (2006) (citation omitted).  As Defendants point out, Plaintiffs do not \n18  identify under which theory they are proceeding.  (See Mot. at 5.)  Plaintiffs seem to \n19  rely on the voluntary recall to establish that there was a defect, but that allegation \n20  alone does not establish liability under any theory.2                 \n21         First, a manufacturing defect theory requires that a \u201cmanufacturing or \n22  production defect is readily identifiable because a defective product is one that \n23  differs from the manufacturer\u2019s intended result or from other ostensibly identical units \n24  of the same product line.\u201d  Barker v. Lull Eng\u2019g Co., 20 Cal. 3d 413, 429 (1978).  \n25  Regarding the electric range, Plaintiffs do not plead that \u201ca suitable design is in place, \n26                                                                        \n\n27  2 Defendants cite out-of-circuit caselaw to posit that a recall cannot constitute a defect.  (See Mot. at 5\u2013\n   6.)  Because Plaintiffs do not plead a theory of liability even when considering the recall, the Court does \n28  not reach this question.                                              \n1  but that the manufacturing process has in some way deviated from that design.\u201d  See \n2  In re Coordinated Latex Glove Litig., 99 Cal. App. 4th 594, 613 (2002).  As such, they \n3  do not state a theory of manufacturing defect.                        \n4       Second, there are two tests for establishing a design defect.  The first is the \n5  consumer expectations test, which requires a plaintiff to show \u201cthat the product failed \n6  to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when using the product in \n7  an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.\u201d  Karlsson, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 1208.  \n8  Plaintiffs do not satisfy this test, as they do not plead that the electric range failed to \n9  perform as safely as expected when used in an intended manner.  The second test is \n10  the risk-benefit test, \u201cwhere the trier of fact is asked to balance the risk of danger \n11  inherent in the challenged design versus the feasibility of a safer design, the gravity of \n12  the danger, and the adverse consequences to the product of a safer design.\u201d  Id.  \n13  Plaintiffs also fail to satisfy this test because they do not plead any factual allegations \n14  regarding the electric range\u2019s danger.  Accordingly, they do not present a theory of \n15  design defect.                                                        \n16       Finally, a failure to warn theory requires a showing that \u201ca flawlessly designed \n17  or manufactured product becomes defective\u201d because the manufacturer failed to \n18  warn of the product\u2019s \u201cdangerous propensities.\u201d  Id.  Because Plaintiffs do not plead \n19  that Defendants failed to warn them of any danger, they do not state a theory of \n20  failure to warn.                                                      \n21       Plaintiffs do not present any viable theory of strict liability, and thus this claim \n22  must also be dismissed on this independent basis.  Accordingly, the Court grants \n23  Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the products liability claim.                \n24  II.  Negligence                                                       \n25       To establish a claim for negligence, \u201ca plaintiff must show that defendant had a \n26  duty to use due care, that he breached that duty, and that the breach was the \n27  proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.\u201d  Nally v. Grace Cmty. Church, 47 Cal. \n28  3d 278, 292 (1988) (citation omitted).  To show proximate cause, a plaintiff must \n1  demonstrate \u201cthe injury was one that should reasonably have been anticipated as a \n2  natural and probable consequence and as an immediate, as distinguished from a \n3  remote or improbable, result of the negligence.\u201d  Harrison v. Gamatero, 52 Cal. App. \n4  2d 178, 182 (1942).                                                   \n5       Plaintiffs do not plead that Defendants had a duty use to care or that they \n6  breached the duty.  Moreover, even if Plaintiffs pleaded those elements, they fall far \n7  short of plausibly stating that any breach was the proximate cause of their injury.  As \n8  explained above, Plaintiffs do not plead any factual allegations showing that \n9  Defendants\u2019 conduct caused the fire.  See supra Discussion Part I.  They therefore fail \n10  to plead that their injury was reasonably \u201canticipated as a natural and probable \n11  consequence\u201d of Defendants\u2019 negligence.  See Harrison, 52 Cal. App. 2d at 182.  \n12  Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the negligence claim. \n13  III.  Breach of Warranty                                              \n14         \u201cTo plead an action for breach of express warranty under California law, a \n15  plaintiff must allege: (1) the exact terms of the warranty; (2) reasonable reliance \n16  thereon; and (3) a breach of warranty which proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d  \n17  Baltazar v. Apple, Inc., Case No. CV-10-3231-JF, 2011 WL 588209, at *2 (N.D. Cal. \n18  Feb. 10, 2011) (citing Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp., 185 Cal. App. 3d 135, 142 \n19  (Ct. App. 1986)).  The Court has already held that Plaintiffs do not show that \n20  Defendants\u2019 conduct was the proximate cause of their injury.  See supra Discussion \n21  Part II.  Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the breach of warranty \n22  claim.                                                                \n23  IV.  Leave to Amend                                                   \n24       A court granting a motion to dismiss a claim must then decide whether to grant \n25  leave to amend.  Leave to amend should be \u201cfreely given\u201d where there is no \u201cundue \n26  delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to \n27  the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of [the] \n28  amendment . . . .\u201d  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Eminence Capital, LLC v. \n1  | Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (listing the Foman factors as those to \n2  |  be considered when deciding whether to grant leave to amend).  Dismissal without \n3  || leave to amend is proper only if it is clear that \u201cthe complaint could not be saved by \n4  |  any amendment.\u201d  Intri-Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Group, Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1056 (9th \n5 || Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). \n6          Here, leave to amend is appropriate because Plaintiffs state that they can plead \n7  |  additional facts, and the Court finds that Plaintiffs could save a claim by amendment. \n8  |  (See Opp\u2019n at 9.)  Moreover, the Court notes that this action was filed in state court, \n9  | which has more liberal pleading standards than federal court, to which this action was \n10  |  removed.  Plaintiffs have not had the opportunity to amend their complaint since \n11  |  removal.  Accordingly, the Court grants leave to amend as to all claims. \n12                                    CONCLUSION \n13          For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 Motion to \n14  |  Dismiss (ECF No. 10) with leave to amend.  The hearing scheduled for August 21, \n15  |  2025, at 1:30 p.m. in Courtroom 7 before District Judge Daniel J. Calabretta is \n16  | VACATED. \n17          If Plaintiffs elect to file an Amended Complaint, they must do so within twenty- \n18  |  one (21) days of this Order.  Defendants shall file their responses to the Amended \n19  | Complaint within twenty-one (21) days thereafter. \n20 \n          IT IS SO ORDERED. \n22  |  Dated:    _July 31, 2025               \u201cDarl J  Cob     tto\u2014 \n                                            Hon.

WOOD, United States District Judge:                              \n    Plaintiff Juan Lovelady, proceeding pro se, is currently detained at the Otis Bantum \nCorrectional Center on Rikers Island (\u201cOBCC\u201d).  On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the \noriginal complaint in this case, alleging that Defendants violated his constitutional rights during \nhis detention at the OBCC.  (ECF No. 1.)  By Order dated January 29, 2025, the Court granted \nPlaintiff leave to file an amended complaint to state facts describing how correctional staff \nviolated his federal constitutional rights.  (ECF No. 8.)  On March 5, 2025, the Court received \nPlaintiff\u2019s amended complaint.  (ECF No. 9.)  Plaintiff alleges that (1) he slipped and fell in his \ncell after the pipes burst and (2) he now suffers from back and knee pain.  (Id. at 9.)  For the \nreasons set forth below, the Court dismisses the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, \nbut grants Plaintiff 30 days\u2019 leave to replead.                           \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW                                 \n    The Court must dismiss a complaint, or any portion of the complaint, that is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from \na defendant who is immune from such relief.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), 1915A(b); see Abbas \nv. Dixon, 480 F.3d 636, 639 (2d Cir. 2007).  The Court must also dismiss a complaint when the \nCourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims raised.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).   \n    Although the law mandates dismissal on any of these grounds, the Court is obligated to \n\nconstrue pro se pleadings liberally, Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir. 2009), and to \ninterpret them to raise the \u201cstrongest [claims] that they suggest,\u201d Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of \nPrisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted) (emphasis in original).  But the \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d courts provide to pro se \nlitigants, id. at 475 (citation omitted), has its limits\u2014to state a claim, pro se pleadings still must \ncomply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires a complaint to make \na short and plain statement showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \n\n                          DISCUSSION                                     \n    The Court construes Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint as asserting a conditions of \nconfinement claim under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  See Darnell v. \n\nPineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 29, 33 n.9 (2d Cir. 2017).                          \n    To state a conditions of confinement claim, a plaintiff must establish two elements: \n(1) that the challenged conditions are sufficiently serious, and (2) that defendant acted with at \nleast deliberate indifference to those conditions.  Id. at 29.  To satisfy the first element, the \nplaintiff must plead facts that \u201cshow that the conditions, either alone or in combination, pose an \nunreasonable risk of serious damage to his health\u201d or safety.  Id. at 30 (citation omitted).  To \nsatisfy the second element, the plaintiff must allege facts showing that a jail official \u201cacted \nintentionally to impose the alleged condition, or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to \nmitigate the risk that the condition posed to the pretrial detainee even though the defendant-\nofficial knew, or should have known, that the condition posed an excessive risk to health or \nsafety.\u201d  Id. at 35.                                                      \n    It is well-established in this Circuit that \u201callegations of wet floor conditions that cause a \nprisoner to slip and fall, standing alone, do not satisfy the first prong of a conditions of \n\nconfinement claim.\u201d  Luckey v. Jonas, No. 18-CV-8103, 2019 WL 4194297, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept. 4, 2019) (Torres, J.) (quoting Lopez v. Phipps, No. 18-CV-3605, 2019 WL 2504097, at *8 \n(E.D.N.Y. June 17, 2019) (collecting cases)); see also Strange v. Westchester Cnty. Dep\u2019t of \nCorr., No. 17-CV-9968, 2018 WL 3910829, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2018) (Rom\u00e1n, J.) \n(\u201cDistrict courts in this Circuit have repeatedly held that, standing alone, a claim that a prisoner \nfell on a slippery floor and injured himself fails to satisfy the first prong of a conditions-of-\nconfinement claim.\u201d).                                                     \n    District courts in this Circuit have also held that a slip and fall claim, standing alone, does \nnot satisfy the second prong of a conditions of confinement claim\u2014that correctional staff \nshowed deliberate indifference to a serious risk of harm.  See, e.g., Fredricks v. City of New York, \n\nNo. 12-CV-3734, 2014 WL 3875181, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (Torres, J.) (\u201cA prisoner\u2019s \nbare complaint about a slippery floor, without more, does not state an arguable claim of \ndeliberate indifference.\u201d); Graham v. Poole, 476 F. Supp. 2d 257, 260 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) \n(\u201cAlthough plaintiff alleges that defendants were aware of the dangerous condition of the shower \nfloor, and failed to rectify it, that amounts to nothing more than negligence.\u201d). \n    Plaintiff does not allege any facts showing that his cell conditions posed an unreasonable \nrisk of serious harm to his health and safety, or that any corrections official was deliberately \nindifferent to a risk of serious harm.  He therefore does not satisfy either element of a condition \nof confinement claim.  Thus, while Plaintiff\u2019s allegations may be sufficient to state a claim of \nnegligence under state law, they do not state a federal claim under Section 1983.  The Court \ntherefore dismisses Plaintiff\u2019s claims under Section 1983 for failure to state a claim on which \nrelief may be granted.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii); 1915A(b)(1).  \n\n\n                  LEAVE TO AMEND IS GRANTED                              \n    Plaintiff proceeds in this matter without the benefit of an attorney.  District courts \ngenerally grant a self-represented plaintiff an opportunity to amend a complaint to cure its \ndefects, unless amendment would be futile.  See Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 123-24 (2d Cir. \n2011); Lucente v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp., 310 F.3d 243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002).  Indeed, the Second \nCircuit has cautioned that district courts \u201cshould not dismiss [a pro se complaint] without \ngranting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any \nindication that a valid claim might be stated.\u201d  Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. \n2000) (quoting Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank, 171 F.3d 794, 795 (2d Cir. 1999)).  Because \nPlaintiff may be able to allege additional facts to state a valid conditions of confinement claim, \nthe Court grants Plaintiff 30 days\u2019 leave to file a second amended complaint. \n\n    If Plaintiff does not file a second amended complaint within the time allowed, the Court \nwill direct the Clerk of Court to enter judgment dismissing this action.  \n\n                          CONCLUSION                                     \n    Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, filed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1), is \ndismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The Court grants Plaintiff 30 days\u2019 leave to file a second amended \ncomplaint.                                                                \n    The Court certifies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) that any appeal from this Order would \nnot be taken in good faith, and therefore in forma pauperis status is denied for the purpose of an \nappeal.  See Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 444-45 (1962).      \n    The Court directs the Clerk of Court to hold this matter open on the docket until a civil \n\njudgment is entered.                                                      \nSO ORDERED.                                                               \nDated:  July 29, 2025                                                    \n      New York, New York                                                 \n\n                                   /s/ Kimba M.

Currently  pending  before  the  Court  is \n12   Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 24.) On May 5, 2025, the Court \n13   gave Scott notice of Defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to the requirements of Klingele v. \n14   Eikenberry, 849 F.2d 409 (9th Cir. 1988), and Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. \n15   1998). (ECF No. 25.) Scott did not timely file his response, thus the Court sua sponte \n16   granted Scott an extension of time to file his response. (ECF No. 26.) To date, Scott has \n17   failed  to file  an opposition  to  the motion. For  the  reasons  stated  below,  the  Court \n18   recommends Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, (ECF No. 24), be granted. \n19   I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY                       \n20        Scott is formerly an inmate incarcerated in the Nevada Department of Corrections \n21   (\u201cNDOC\u201d) and housed at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center (\u201cNNCC\u201d). On June 8, \n22   2023, Scott submitted a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging he was \n23   retaliated against for seeking medical treatment. (ECF No. 1-1.) In this complaint, Scott \n24   alleges that he has a kidney condition for which he receives dialysis treatment. (Id. at 4.) \n25   Nephrologist Dr. Quigley ordered that all dialysis patients, including Scott, receive a bag \n26   of ice daily as part of their treatment. (Id.) Dr. Quigley\u2019s order for medical ice was not set \n\n27   1    This Report and Recommendation is made to the Honorable Miranda M. Du, \n    United States District Judge. The action was referred to the undersigned Magistrate \n1   to expire until November 2023. (Id.) But prison medical staff discontinued Dr. Quigley\u2019s \n2   order before then. (Id.)                                             \n3        On November 17, 2022, Scott alleges he met with Dr. Quigley and prison nurse \n4   Melissa Michell for his monthly medical consultation regarding his medical condition and \n5   dialysis treatment. (Id.) Scott asked Dr. Quigley to reinstate his order for medical ice. (Id. \n6   at 5.) Scott asked Dr. Quigley to make the order just for him based on his own medical \n7   needs even Scott knew that Dr. Quigley preferred to issue orders that applied to all \n8   dialysis patients, not for each patient individually. (Id.)          \n9        Scott alleges that on the same day, Michell wrote Scott up on a \u201ctrumped up charge \n10   of Compromising Staff (a Class A offense).\u201d (Id.) Scott alleges this resulted in him being \n11   housed in segregation \u201cfor an extended period of time and having his [liberties] placed in \n12   jeopardy unduly.\u201d (Id. at 6.) On December 3, 2022, a preliminary hearing was held where \n13   Scott pled not guilty to the charge and provided a statement. (ECF No. 24-2 at 3.) On \n14   January 31, 2023, Scott was found not guilty of the charge. (Id. at 5.)  \n15        On  December  9, 2022,  Scott  initiated informal  grievance  No.  2006-31-46153 \n16   alleging he was retaliated against for \u201cengag[ing] in activity protected by the Eighth \n17   Amendment access to proper and adequate medical treatment.\u201d (ECF No. 24-3 at 50.) \n18   On January 3, 2023, Scott\u2019s informal grievance was denied for including more than one \n    issue on his grievance. (Id.) On March 7, 2023, Scott resubmitted his informal grievance. \n19                                                                        \n    (Id.) On April 3, 2023, the informal grievance was denied for \u201cno harm/loss, action or \n20                                                                        \n    remedy.\u201d (Id.) On May 9, 2023, Scott again resubmitted his informal grievance. (Id.) On \n21                                                                        \n    May 30, 2023, Scott\u2019s informal grievance was again denied for \u201cno harm/loss, action or \n22                                                                        \n    remedy.\u201d (Id.) Scott never raised the grievance beyond the informal level. (Id.) \n23                                                                        \n         On June 12, 2023, Scott filed suit alleging a First Amendment retaliation claim \n24                                                                        \n    against Michell, which was allowed proceed following the screening of Scott\u2019s complaint. \n25                                                                        \n    (ECF Nos. 1-1; 6.)                                                   \n26                                                                        \n         On May 2, 2025, Defendants filed the instant motion arguing summary judgment \n27                                                                        \n    should be granted in their favor because: (1) Scott failed to exhaust his administrative \n1   remedies; and (2) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. (ECF No. 24.) Scott\u2019s \n2   opposition was due on May 23, 2025, which he did not file. On May 28, 2025, the Court \n3   sua sponte extended Scott\u2019s deadline to oppose Defendants\u2019 motion. (ECF No. 26.) To \n4   date, however, Scott has not filed an opposition or otherwise responded to Defendants\u2019 \n5   motion.                                                              \n6   II.  LEGAL STANDARDS                                                 \n7        \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \n8   genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \n9   of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The \n10   substantive law applicable to the claim determines which facts are material. Coles v. \n11   Eagle, 704 F.3d 624, 628 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, \n12   248 (1986)). Only disputes over facts that address the main legal question of the suit can \n13   preclude summary judgment, and factual disputes that are irrelevant are not material. \n14   Frlekin v. Apple, Inc., 979 F.3d 639, 644 (9th Cir. 2020). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only where \n15   a reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. \n16        The parties subject to a motion for summary judgment must: (1) cite facts from the \n17   record, including but not limited to depositions, documents, and declarations, and then \n18   (2) \u201cshow[] that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine \n19   dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d \n20   Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c)(1).  Documents  submitted  during  summary  judgment  must  be \n21   authenticated, and if only personal knowledge authenticates a document (i.e., even a \n22   review of the contents of the document would not prove that it is authentic), an affidavit \n23   attesting to its authenticity must be attached to the submitted document. Las Vegas \n24   Sands, LLC v. Neheme, 632 F.3d 526, 532-33 (9th Cir. 2011). Conclusory statements, \n25   speculative opinions, pleading allegations, or other assertions uncorroborated by facts \n26   are insufficient to establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute. Soremekun v. \n27   Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007).            \n1   genuine dispute. See id. \u201cWhere the moving party will have the burden of proof on an \n2   issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact \n3   could find other than for the moving party.\u201d Id. However, if the moving party does not bear \n4   the  burden  of  proof  at  trial,  the  moving  party  may  meet  their  initial  burden  by \n5   demonstrating either: (1) there is an absence of evidence to support an essential element \n6   of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim or claims; or (2) submitting admissible evidence that \n7   establishes the record forecloses the possibility of a reasonable jury finding in favor of the \n8   nonmoving party. See Pakootas v. Teck Cominco Metals, Ltd., 905 F.3d 565, 593-94 (9th \n9   Cir. 2018); Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. \n10   2000). The court views all evidence and any inferences arising therefrom in the light most \n11   favorable to the nonmoving party. Colwell v. Bannister, 763 F.3d 1060, 1065 (9th Cir. \n12   2014). If the moving party does not meet its burden for summary judgment, the nonmoving \n13   party is not required to provide evidentiary materials to oppose the motion, and the court \n14   will deny summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.             \n15        Where the moving party has met its burden, however, the burden shifts to the \n16   nonmoving  party  to  establish  that  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  actually  exists. \n17   Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, (1986). The \n18   nonmoving must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings\u201d to meet this burden. Pac. Gulf Shipping Co. \n19   v. Vigorous Shipping & Trading S.A., 992 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2021) (internal quotation \n20   omitted). In other words, the nonmoving party may not simply rely upon the allegations or \n21   denials of its pleadings; rather, they must tender evidence of specific facts in the form of \n22   affidavits, and/or admissible discovery material in support of its contention that such a \n23   dispute exists. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 n. 11. This burden \n24   is \u201cnot a light one,\u201d and requires the nonmoving party to \u201cshow more than the mere \n25   existence of a scintilla of evidence.\u201d Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 n. 11 (quoting In re \n26   Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010)). The non-moving party \u201cmust \n27   come forth with evidence from which a jury could reasonably render a verdict in the non-\n1   Litig., 627 F.3d at 387). Mere assertions and \u201cmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts\u201d \n2   will  not  defeat  a  properly  supported  and  meritorious  summary  judgment  motion. \n3   Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586-87.                                      \n4        When a pro se litigant opposes summary judgment, his or her contentions in \n5   motions and pleadings may be considered as evidence to meet the non-party\u2019s burden to \n6   the extent: (1) contents of the document are based on personal knowledge, (2) they set \n7   forth facts that would be admissible into evidence, and (3) the litigant attested under \n8   penalty of perjury that they were true and correct. Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 923 \n9   (9th Cir. 2004).                                                     \n10        Upon the parties meeting their respective burdens for the motion for summary \n11   judgment, the court determines whether reasonable minds could differ when interpreting \n12   the record; the court does not weigh the evidence or determine its truth. Velazquez v. City \n13   of Long Beach, 793 F.3d 1010, 1018 (9th Cir. 2015). The court may consider evidence in \n14   the record not cited by the parties, but it is not required to do so. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15   56(c)(3). Nevertheless, the Court will view the cited records before it and will not mine the \n16   record for triable issues of fact. Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d at 386 (holding that if a \n17   nonmoving party does not make nor provide support for a possible objection, the court \n18   will likewise not consider it).                                      \n19   III.  DISCUSSION                                                     \n20        Defendants argue summary judgment should be entered because Scott failed to \n21   exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit. (ECF No. 24.) Under the \n22   Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison \n23   conditions under [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in \n24   any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are \n25   available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Exhaustion is mandatory. See Porter v. \n26   Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002). The requirement\u2019s underlying premise is to \u201creduce \n27   the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits\u201d by affording prison officials the \u201ctime \n1   case. In some instances, corrective action taken in response to an inmate\u2019s grievance \n2   might improve prison administration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obviating the need \n3   for litigation.\u201d Id. at 524-25.                                      \n4        The PLRA requires \u201cproper exhaustion\u201d of an inmate\u2019s claims. Woodford v. Ngo, \n5   548 U.S. 81, 90 (2006). Proper exhaustion means an inmate must \u201cuse all steps the prison \n6   holds out, enabling the prison to reach the merits of the issue.\u201d Griffin v. Arpaio, 557 F.3d \n7   1117, 1119 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90). Thus, exhaustion \u201cdemands \n8   compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical procedural rules because no \n9   adjudication system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on \n10   the course of its proceedings.\u201d Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90-91.         \n11        In the Ninth Circuit, a motion for summary judgment will typically be the appropriate \n12   vehicle to determine whether an inmate has properly exhausted his or her administrative \n13   remedies. Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1169 (9th Cir. 2014). \u201cIf undisputed evidence \n14   viewed in the light most favorable to the prisoner shows a failure to exhaust, a defendant \n15   is entitled to summary judgment under Rule 56. If material facts are disputed, summary \n16   judgment should be denied, and the district judge rather than a jury should determine the \n17   facts.\u201d Id. at 1166. The question of exhaustion \u201cshould be decided, if feasible, before \n18   reaching the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d Id. at 1170.             \n19        Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 \n20   (2007). The defendant bears the burden of proving that an available administrative \n21   remedy was unexhausted by the inmate. Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172. If the defendant makes \n22   such a showing, the burden shifts to the inmate to \u201cshow there is something in his case \n23   that  made  the  existing  and  generally  available  administrative  remedies  effectively \n24   unavailable to him by \u2018showing that the local remedies were ineffective, unobtainable, \n25   unduly prolonged, inadequate, or obviously futile.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Paramo, 775 F.3d 1182, \n26   1191 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172).             \n27   ///                                                                  \n1        A.   NDOC\u2019s Inmate Grievance System                             \n2        Administrative Regulation (\u201cAR\u201d) 740 governs the grievance process at NDOC \n3   institutions. (See ECF No. 24-6.) An inmate must grieve through all three levels: (1) \n4   Informal; (2) First Level; and (3) Second Level. (Id. at 11-16.) The inmate may file an \n5   informal grievance within six months \u201cif the issue involves personal property damages or \n6   loss, personal injury, medical claims or any other tort claims, including civil rights claims.\u201d \n7   (Id. at 11.) The inmate\u2019s failure to submit the informal grievance within this period \u201cshall \n8   constitute abandonment of the inmate\u2019s grievance at this, and all subsequent levels.\u201d (Id. \n9   at 12.) NDOC staff is required to respond within forty-five days. (Id. at 13.)  \n10        Per AR 740, a grievance at any level may be either, \u201cgranted, denied, partially \n11   granted, abandoned, duplicate, not accepted or grievable, resolved, settled, withdrawn; \n12   or referred to the Office of the Inspector General.\u201d (Id. at 3.) If a grievance is \u201cgranted\u201d or \n13   resolved by \u201csettlement\u201d at any level, the grievance process is considered complete. (Id. \n14   at 6.) However, if a grievance is either \u201cpartially granted, denied, or resolved\u201d at any level, \n15   the inmate must appeal the response to the next level for the grievance process to be \n16   deemed \u201ccomplete\u201d for purposes of exhausting their administrative remedies. (Id.)  \n17        The appeal of an informal grievance is called a \u201cFirst Level Grievance\u201d and must \n18   be filed within 5 days of receiving a response. (Id. at 13.) A First Level Grievance should \n19   be reviewed, investigated, and responded to by the Warden at the institution where the \n20   incident  being  grieved  occurred;  however,  the  Warden  may  utilize  any  staff  in  the \n21   development of a grievance response. (Id.) The time limit for a response to the inmate is \n22   forty-five days. (Id. at 14.)                                        \n23        Within five days of receiving a First Level response, the inmate may appeal to the \n24   Second Level Grievance, which is subject to still-higher review. (Id. at 15.) Officials are to \n25   respond to a Second Level Grievance within sixty days, specifying the decision and the \n26   reasons the decision was reached. (Id.at 15.) Upon receiving a response to the Second \n27   Level  Grievance,  the  inmate  will  be  deemed  to  have  exhausted  his  administrative \n1        B.   Analysis                                                   \n2        In this case, Defendants argue Scott failed to properly exhaust his administrative \n3   remedies because he did not fully appeal his grievances through all the necessary \n4   grievance  levels.  (ECF  No.  24  at  5-11.)  To  support  their  arguments,  Defendants \n5   submitted copies of Scott\u2019s inmate grievance history, including the grievance that relates \n6   to the claim at issue in this case\u2014Grievance No. 2006-31-46153. (See ECF No. 24-3 \n7   (Scott\u2019s Inmate Grievance History).)                                 \n8        A careful review of these records supports Defendants\u2019 arguments. Although Scott \n9   filed an informal grievance related to alleged incidents of his claim in this case, the \n10   grievance was not properly grieved through all three levels as required by AR 740. On \n11   December 9, 2022, Scott initiated Informal Grievance No. 2006-31-46153 asserting he \n    was retaliated against by Michell. (See ECF No. 24-3 at 50.) On January 3, 2023, Scott\u2019s \n12                                                                        \n    informal grievance was denied for including more than one issue on his grievance. (Id.) \n13                                                                        \n    On March 7, 2023, Scott resubmitted his informal grievance. (Id.) On April 3, 2023, the \n14                                                                        \n    informal grievance was again denied for \u201cno harm/loss, action or remedy.\u201d (Id.) On May \n15                                                                        \n    9, 2023, Scott again resubmitted his informal grievance. (Id.)

No other grievances regarding \n18                                                                        \n    the retaliation claim here was filed.                                \n19                                                                        \n         It is well established that the PLRA requires \u201cproper exhaustion\u201d of an inmate\u2019s \n20                                                                        \n    claims. See Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90. Proper exhaustion means an inmate must \u201cuse all \n21                                                                        \n    steps the prison holds out, enabling the prison to reach the merits of the issue.\u201d Griffin, \n22                                                                        \n    557 F.3d at 1119 (citing Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90) (emphasis added). Additionally, \n23                                                                        \n    \u201cproper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical \n24                                                                        \n    procedural rules.\u201d Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90. Here, it appears Scott failed to follow all \n25                                                                        \n    required steps to allow prison officials to reach the merits of the issue as he failed to file \n26                                                                        \n    any grievance past the informal level related to the claims in this case as required \n27                                                                        \n    pursuant to AR 740. Accordingly, the Court finds Scott failed to exhaust his administrative \n1   remedies pursuant to AR 740 prior to initiating this action. As such, Defendants have met \n2   their burden to establish Scott failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in his case. \n3        The burden now shifts to Scott \u201cto come forward with evidence showing that there \n4   is  something  in  his  particular  case  that  made  the  existing  and  generally  available \n5   administrative remedies effectively unavailable to him.\u201d Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172 (citing \n6   Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 778 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1996)). However, because \n7   Scott did not oppose Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, he provides no evidence \n8   to  show  that  administrative  remedies  were  unavailable  to  him.  As  stated  above, \n9   Grievance No. 2006-31-46153 was resubmitted multiple times but never raised beyond \n10   the informal level. (ECF No. 24-3 at 50.) Scott does not demonstrate a genuine dispute \n11   of material as to whether he properly raised his grievance to the First and Second Level \n12   and exhausted the available administrative remedies by failing to prosecute this case and \n13   oppose Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. See Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172. \n14        Because Scott presents no evidence that administrative remedies were effectively \n15   \u201cunavailable,\u201d  the  Court  concludes  Scott  failed  to  exhaust  available  administrative \n16   remedies prior to filling this action. Accordingly, the Court recommends Defendants\u2019 \n17   motion for summary judgment be granted.2                             \n18   IV.

Scott alleged that prison medical staff stopped providing him with a daily bag of ice, which was part of his dialysis treatment, despite a doctor's order. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which Scott failed to respond to, and the court is recommending that the motion be granted. The key legal issue is whether Scott's civil rights were violated, and the type of injury alleged is denial of medical treatment."

GARNETT, United States District Judge: \n     Plaintiff Clint Arthur, an individual entrepreneur who offers consulting services on how \nto land television appearances, brought this action against Defendants Orchestrate Business LLC \nand Raffi Andonian, seeking lost revenue, damages, and injunctive relief.  Arthur primarily \nalleges that Defendants misappropriated Arthur\u2019s proprietary business information in order to \nsolicit his customers to pay for similar services offered by Defendants.  Defendants moved to \ndismiss the First Amended Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim \nunder Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  For the reasons \nstated herein, the Court GRANTS the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. \n                  FACTS & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND! \n     Plaintiff Clint Arthur coaches businesses and individuals on securing television \nappearances and leveraging those appearances into business opportunities.  Dkt. No. 12 (\u201cFirst \n\n     ' These facts are drawn from the First Amended Complaint, materials appended to the First \nAmended Complaint, and materials submitted by the parties in connection with Defendants\u2019 motion to \ndismiss. \n     The Court shall refer to the parties\u2019 memoranda of law in support of and opposition to \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as follows:  Dkt.

Among other things, Arthur offers seminars where \nattendees learn \u201cconfidential secrets and best practices,\u201d including his \u201cMathematical Formula \nfor Getting on TV,\u201d which draws on Arthur\u2019s own experience in the television industry.  See id. \n9 14-15 & Ex. A (\u201cArthur Decl.\u201d) \u00a7 10. \n      Defendant Raffi Andonian, a citizen of Missouri, is the sole partner and owner of \nDefendant Orchestrate Business LLC (\u201cOrchestrate Business\u201d), an LLC organized under the \nlaws of Missouri with a principal place of business in Saint Louis, Missouri, which offers similar \nconsulting services to those offered by Plaintiff.  See FAC \u25a1 7-8, 13.  From August 2020 \nthrough October 2023, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Acapulco, Mexico, Andonian attended four \nseminars hosted by Arthur, over the course of which Andonian and Arthur developed a \nprofessional relationship.  See id. \u00a7 18; Arthur Decl. {J 4, 6.  At each seminar, Andonian signed \nan agreement (the \u201cSeminar Agreement\u201d), under which Andonian agreed not to use resources \nprovided or concepts taught at the seminar to \u201ccompete\u201d with Arthur or his business.  See FAC \n  16-17, 20; Arthur Decl.   75.  At some point after attending these seminars, Andonian asked \nArthur for permission to use information taught by Arthur to launch his own business.  See FAC \n\u00a7 21; Arthur Decl. \u00a7 7.  Although Arthur denied Andonian\u2019s request, Andonian still allegedly \nused the information he learned from Arthur in seminars offered by Orchestrate Business.  See \nFAC \u25a1 22-24. \n      Defendants\u2019 website, www.tvseminar.tv, advertises a syllabus for a training program, \nwhich Arthur alleges borrows heavily from or outright copies the techniques Arthur has \ndeveloped over the years to train his clients for television appearances.  See id. { 24; Arthur Decl. \n 8-11; see also FAC Ex. B  (screenshots of Defendants\u2019 website).  Interested clients may sign \nup for seminars offered by Defendants using the \u201cRSVP\u201d button on the website.  See FAC Ex. B.\n\nDefendant Andonian also manages a personal social media account, which he uses to post, \namong other things, advertisements that appear to be related to Orchestrate Business.  See Opp. \n    Az \n      Arthur alleges that several prospective clients have been solicited by Defendants\u2014 \nspecifically, Arthur alleges that Andonian has reached out to Arthur\u2019s prospective clients and \nencouraged them to purchase seminars offered by Orchestrate Business instead of Arthur\u2019s \nseminars.  See FAC \u00a7\u00a7 25\u201426; Arthur Decl. ff 12-16.  One such client was William Belfar, who \npreviously attended several of Arthur\u2019s seminars and attended weekly private coaching sessions \nwith Arthur.  Supp. Opp. Ex. B. (\u201cBelfar Decl.\u201d) 9 4\u20146.  Belfar is a New York citizen, who \npurchased and attended a seminar offered by Andonian in St. Louis, Missouri on April 26\u201428, \n2024.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1-3.  Since attending Andonian\u2019s seminar, Belfar has not attended any other \nseminars offered by Arthur.  Jd. JJ 13-14. \n      On April 19, 2024, Arthur filed the Complaint in this action, asserting state law causes of \naction, including breach of contract, tortious interference with a business relationship, and unfair \ncompetition.  See Dkt. No. 1.  On April 23, 2024, the Court ordered Arthur to file an amended \ncomplaint in order to correct the Complaint\u2019s deficient allegations regarding complete diversity \nof citizenship.  See Dkt. No. 9.  On May 17, 2024, Arthur filed the First Amended Complaint. \nOn June 21, 2024, Defendants moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) and failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Dkt. \nNo. 24.  Several months after Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was fully briefed, on September 17, \n2024, Arthur simultaneously filed a supplemental memorandum of law and other materials in \nfurther opposition to the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and moved for leave \nto file such materials.  See Dkt. No. 31-1 & Supp. Opp.\n\n                                DISCUSSION \n      Defendants argue that the First Amended Complaint should be dismissed because \n(1) Arthur has failed to establish that this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants; and (2) Arthur has failed to sufficiently plead any of his claims for various reasons, \nincluding because the restrictive covenant in the Seminar Agreement is categorically \nunenforceable and facially invalid.  Defendants also argue that the Court should deny any request \nto further amend the First Amended Complaint because such an amendment would be futile. \n      The Court starts, as it must, with personal jurisdiction.  See Romero v. 88 Acres Foods, \nInc., 580 F. Supp. 3d 9, 14 (S.D.N.Y. 2022); N. Fork Partners Inv. Holdings, LLC v. Bracken, \nNo. 20-CV-02444 (LJL), 2020 WL 6899486, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. 2020).  Because the Court does not \nhave personal jurisdiction over Defendants, there is no need to reach Defendants\u2019 other stated \ngrounds for dismissal. \nL     MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL OPPOSITION \n      As a threshold matter, Arthur\u2019s motion for leave to file his supplemental opposition to the \nmotion to dismiss is granted, and the Court will consider both Arthur\u2019s supplemental opposition \nand the materials appended thereto. \n      \u201cSupplemental filings on motions fully submitted require leave of court.\u201d AA Med. P.C. \nv. Almansoori, No. 20-CV-03852 (DG) (JMW), 2023 WL 4073772, at *2 (E.D.N-Y. June 19, \n2023) (citing Ruggiero v. Warner-Lambert Co., 424 F.3d 249, 252 (2d Cir. 2005)).  Generally, \ncourts in this Circuit look \u201cfavorably on efforts to supplement the record absent prejudice or bad \nfaith.\u201d  SL-x IP S.A.R.L. v. Bank of Am.

(quoting Katz v. Donna Karan Co., L.L.C., 872 F.3d 114, 121 (2d Cir. 2017)); \nsee also APWU v.

Republic of \nAngola, 216 F.3d 36, 40 (D.C.

Dec. 29, 2017). \n      Here, Arthur\u2019s supplemental opposition and supporting materials solely relate to Belfar\u2019s \npurported transactions with Defendants\u2019 business, which are relevant to the disputed \njurisdictional facts in this action, were disclosed during the course of discovery, and were \nunknown to Arthur at the time of the filing of his original opposition.  See Supp. Opp. at 1. \nAccordingly, absent any showing of prejudice or bad faith, and given that Defendants have not \nopposed Arthur\u2019s request, the Court has considered the additional materials submitted by Arthur \nin assessing whether Arthur has sufficiently alleged personal jurisdiction over Defendants. \nII.     RULE 12(B)(2) MOTION TO DISMISS \n      A.     Legal Standard \n      \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the \nCourt has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d Kamal v. Pressler, Felt  & Warshaw, LLP, \nNo. 23-CV-10487 (MKV), 2025 WL 919505, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2025) (citing Penachio v.\n\nBenedict, 461 F. App\u2019x 4, 5 (2d Cir. 2012)).  \u201cTo make a prima facie showing of personal \njurisdiction, a plaintiff \u2018must include an averment of facts that, if credited by the ultimate trier of \nfact, would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.\u2019\u201d Jd. (quoting Dorchester Fin. \nSec., Inc. v. Banco BRJ, S.A., 722 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 2013)). \n      In assessing whether a plaintiff has made a sufficient prima facie showing, the Court \nmust \u201cconstrue the pleadings and any supporting materials in the light most favorable\u201d to the \nplaintiff, Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir. 2013), \nand resolve all doubts in his favor, V&A Collection, LLC v. Guzzini Props. Ltd., 46 F Ath 127, \n131 (2d Cir. 2022).  The Court may consider materials outside the pleadings when making this \nassessment.  See Am. Girl, LLC v. Zembrka, 118 F Ath 271, 276 (2d Cir. 2024).  However, the \nCourt cannot \u201cdraw argumentative inferences in the plaintiff's favor\u201d and need not accept \nconclusory legal statements.  O'Neil] v. Asat Trust Reg., 714 F.3d 659, 673 (2d Cir. 2013). \n      There are three traditional bases for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant. \nFirst, a court may exercise general jurisdiction over a defendant that is \u201cessentially at home in \nthe forum State.\u201d Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 119 (2014).  Second, a court may \nexercise \u201cspecific or conduct-linked jurisdiction\u201d where there is a sufficient link between the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct in the forum and the conduct at issue in the case.  Sonera Holding B.V. v. \nCukurova Holding A.S., 750 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir. 2014).  Third, a defendant can consent to the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction.  Rabinowitz v. Kelman, 75 F Ath 73, 83 (2d Cir. 2023): D.H. \nBlair & Co. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 103 (2d Cir. 2006).  In all cases, the exercise of personal \njurisdiction must comport with fundamental notions of due process.  See Daimler, 571 U.S. at\n\n      Here, Defendants have not consented to the exercise of personal jurisdiction, so the Court \nmust analyze whether Arthur has sufficiently established that the Court has either general or \nspecific personal jurisdiction over Defendants.  To determine whether the Court has general or \nspecific personal jurisdiction over Defendants, \u201c[i]n the absence of a federal statute specifically \ndirecting otherwise, . . . [the Court] look[s] to the law of the forum state to determine whether a \nfederal district court has personal jurisdiction,\u201d which, here, is New York law.  See Brown v. \nLockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 624 (2d Cir. 2016). \n      B.     Discussion \n      Even considering Arthur\u2019s supplemental submission, Arthur has not made a  sufficient \nprima facie showing that Defendants are subject to either general or specific personal jurisdiction \nin New York. \n            i;     Arthur Fails to Establish General Jurisdiction \n      General personal jurisdiction subjects a defendant to suit on all claims.  See Daimler, 571 \nU.S. at 127.  In New York, courts exercise general jurisdiction pursuant to New York Civil \nPractice Law and Rules (\u201cCPLR\u201d) \u00a7 301.  \u201c[OJ]nly a  limited set of affiliations with a forum will \nrender a defendant amenable to [general] jurisdiction there.\u201d Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137.  Fora \nforeign corporate entity, the entity must be \u201cengaged in such a continuous and systematic course \nof \u2018doing business\u2019 [in New York] as to warrant a finding of its \u2018presence\u2019 in this jurisdiction.\u201d \nTrisura Ins. Co. v. Bighorn Constr. and Reclamation, LLC, No. 23-CV-11053 (GHW), 2025 WL \n1531676, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 28, 2025) (quoting McGowan v. Smith, 52 N.Y.2d 268, 272 \n(1981)).  Courts have exercised general personal jurisdiction over a limited liability company \nwhere the company has been organized under the laws of the forum state or maintains its \nprincipal place of business in the forum state.  See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Onanfe Mgmt. Solutions \nLLC, No. 22-CV-06792 (PKC) (MMH), 2024 WL 4184485, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2024); cf \n\nTrisura Ins. Co., 2025 WL 1531676, at *6 (declining to exercise general jurisdiction over a \nTexas LLC where the company did not conduct any operations, engage in any marketing \nactivities, or maintain any real property or accounts in New York, and none of its members, \nofficers, directors, or employees were in New York).  A corporate entity\u2019s domiciles are the \n\u201cparadigm bases\u201d for a forum\u2019s authority over a non-resident entity, and a corporate entity can \nonly become subject to the personal jurisdiction of an additional forum if the entity\u2019s contacts \nwith the forum state are \u201cso continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home.\u201d See \nDaimler, 571 U.S. at 138-39 & n.19 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Goodyear \nDunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011)).  \u201cFor an individual, the \nparadigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual\u2019s domicile.\u201d  Goodyear, \n564 U.S. at 924. \n      Here, neither defendant is domiciled in New York for purposes of general personal \njurisdiction.  Arthur affirmatively alleges that both Defendants are citizens of Missouri, and the \nonly asserted basis for personal jurisdiction over Defendants is under CPLR \u00a7  302, not \u00a7 301. \nSee FAC 4 6-8.  Moreover, for the reasons discussed infra, Arthur has not sufficiently shown \nthat this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which Orchestrate Business\u2019 contacts with New York are \u201cso \ncontinuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home\u201d in this jurisdiction.  See Daimler, \n571 US. at 139 n.19.  Accordingly, the Court finds that it cannot exercise general personal \njurisdiction over Defendants. \n            Ds     Arthur Fails to Establish Specific Jurisdiction \n      Even where general jurisdiction is lacking, a court may have specific jurisdiction \u201cover a \ndefendant in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d Jn re \nPlatinum and Palladium Antitr. Litig., 61  F 4th 242, 269 (2d Cir. 2023).  Under CPLR \u00a7 302(a), \nNew York\u2019s long-arm statute, a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary\n\ndefendant where the claim asserted against the defendant arises out of particular acts, including \n(1) transacting business within New York or contracting anywhere to supply goods or services in \nNew York; (2) committing a tortious act in New York; or (3) committing a tortious act without \nthe state, which causes injury to a person or property in New York.  See CPLR \u00a7 302(a): \nForstech Tech. Nigeria Ltd. v. Shell Petroleum Dev. Co. of Nigeria Ltd. (SPDC), No. 24-CV- \n07629 (PAE), 2025 WL 1435203, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2025); Kamal, 2025 WL 919505, at \n\n      The totality of the circumstances and the quality of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the \nforum are both relevant to establishing specific personal jurisdiction.  Forstech Tech. Nigeria \nLtd., 2025 WL 1435203, at *4.  The inquiry \u201cfocuses on the relationship among the defendant, \nthe forum, and the litigation.\u201d  Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284 (2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) (quoting Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 775 (1984)).  \u201c[T]he \nrelationship must arise out of contacts that the defendant himself creates with the forum State. . . . \n[The Supreme Court has] consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-focused \nminimum contacts inquiry by demonstrating contacts between . . . third parties[] and the forum \nState.\u201d Jd. (emphasis in original) (internal references omitted). \n      Here, in the First Amended Complaint, Arthur alleges that Defendants \u201cdo substantial \nbusiness in the State of New York and committed the unlawful acts giving rise to this claim \nwithin the State of New York.\u201d  FAC 4 11.  In his oppositions to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, \nArthur argues that Defendants have both transacted business and committed a tortious act against \nhim in New York to sufficiently establish personal jurisdiction, and there is \u201ca reasonable \nprobability that [their] website has been used to affect commercial transactions with customers in \nNew York\u201d sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts inquiry.  See Opp. at 19-21; Supp. Opp. at\n\n2.  While the Court must construe the allegations in the First Amended Complaint in the light \nmost favorable to Arthur, even under this lenient standard Arthur has not made a prima facie \nshowing that Defendants purposefully transacted business or committed a tortious act in New \nYork. \n                  i.      Defendants Did Not Transact Business in New York \n      With respect to a defendant\u2019s business transactions in New York, \u201c[CPLR \u00a7] 302 is a \nsingle act statute and proof of one transaction in New York is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction, \neven though the defendant never enters New York, so long as the defendant\u2019s activities here \nwere purposeful and there is a substantial relationship between the transaction at the claim \nasserted.\u201d Am. Girl,  118 F.4th at 276 (internal references omitted) (quoting Chloe v. Queen Bee \nof Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 170 (2d Cir. 2010)).  \u201cThe quality of a defendant\u2019s New \nYork contacts is the \u2018primary consideration\u2019 in deciding whether the defendant transacted \nbusiness in New York.\u201d  Green Earth Enter., LLC v. Sana Benefits, Inc., No. 24-CV-01852 \n(MMG), 2025 WL 1425325, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 16, 2025) (quoting Fischbarg v. Doucet, 9 \nN.Y.3d 375, 380 (2007)). \n      A defendant may, \u201cthrough [a] website, \u2018purposefully avail[] himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within New York, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u2019\u201d \nBest Van Lines, Inc. v.  Walker, 490 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting CutCo Indus. v. \nNaughton, 806 F.2d 361, 365 (2d Cir. 1986)).  Whether a defendant\u2019s website transacts business \nin New York depends on the website\u2019s \u201cdegree of interactivity.\u201d  Sanchez v. NutCo, Inc., No. 20- \nCV-10107 (JPO), 2022 WL 846896, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2022); see also Best Van Lines, \nInc., 490 F.3d at 252.  On a \u201csliding scale of interactivity,\u201d courts determine whether the internet \nactivity at issue occurred on a \u201cpassive\u201d website, which \u201cmerely ma[d]e information available to \ninterested visitors,\u201d or an \u201cinteractive\u201d website, \u201cthrough which a defendant clearly \u2018does \n                                      10 \n\nbusiness over the internet.\u2019\u201d  Creative Photographers, Inc. v. Grupo Televisa, S.A.B., 763 F. \nSupp. 3d 618, 633 (S.D.N.Y. 2025).  \u201cFully interactive websites, which are used to purposefully \nsell goods or services in New York . . . can be sufficient to trigger jurisdiction under \u00a7 302(a)(1) \nwhere the cause of action arises out of such purposeful activity.\u201d Jd. (internal references \nomitted).  However, a highly interactive website alone is insufficient to support the exercise of \nspecific personal jurisdiction\u2014in order to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction, a \ndefendant must have used the website to purposely avail itself of the forum state.  Romero v. 88 \nAcres Foods, Inc., 580 F. Supp. 3d 9, 15 (S.D.N-Y. 2022). \n      Here, Arthur has failed to sufficiently allege or show that Defendants have purposefully \ntransacted or solicited business within New York.  Neither Defendants\u2019 website nor the various \nsocial media posts depicting Defendants in connection with New York-related landmarks and \nNew York Life Insurance, individually or in the aggregate, are sufficient to support the exercise \nof specific personal jurisdiction. \n      With respect to the website, Arthur argues that Defendants\u2019 website was \u201cavailable to \nthose residing within ..  . New York,\u201d and potential customers could seek Defendants\u2019 services \nby selecting the \u201cRSVP\u201d button on the website and inputting user-specific information, and \nthereafter, receive an invoice for Defendants\u2019 services.  See Opp. at 20-21.  To start, counsel\u2019s \nunsworn and unsubstantiated statements in Arthur\u2019s opposition are not cognizable evidence for \npurposes of establishing whether this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants.  Kulhawik \nv. Holder, 571 F.3d 296, 298 (2d Cir. 2009) (\u201cAn attorney\u2019s unsworn statements in a brief are \nnot evidence.\u201d).\u201d \n\n      ? Defendants argue that counsel\u2019s assertions about how potential customers sought out \nDefendants\u2019 services using their website are \u201cspeculati[ve],\u201d\u201d Reply at 10, but fail to specifically rebut or \ncontrovert counsel\u2019s representations with specific averments or evidence refuting jurisdiction. \n                                      11 \n\n      Even taking as true the representations in Arthur\u2019s opposition regarding Defendants\u2019 \nwebsite, Arthur has not sufficiently shown that Defendants purposefully solicited New York \ncustomers through their website or actually transmitted their services to New York.  On its face, \nDefendants\u2019 website does appear interactive and commercial in nature, given that the website \nfeatures Defendants\u2019 paid services and encourages interested consumers to \u201cRSVP.\u201d  Cf \nA.W.LJI. Grp, Inc. v. Amber Freight Shipping Lines, 828 F. Supp. 2d 557, 568-69 (E.D.N_Y. \n2011) (finding the defendant\u2019s website was passive where customers could not transact for the \ndefendant\u2019s services and the defendant did not purposefully solicit New York customers and its \nwebsite was not in any way targeted towards New York).  However, the interactive or \ncommercial nature of Defendants\u2019 website or the availability of Defendants\u2019 website to users in \nNew York is, by itself, insufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction, given that \nArthur has not shown that Defendants in fact used their website to purposefully avail themselves \nof the privilege of conducting activities within New York.  See Romero, 580 F. Supp. 3d at 15; \nCreative Photographers, Inc., 763 F. Supp. 3d at 633 (\u201c[T]he mere availability of [a] [web]site to \nusers in New York, standing alone, does not amount to transacting business in the state for \npurposes of [CPLR \u00a7] 302(a).\u201d). \n      While Defendants need not have offered their seminars in New York or have been \nphysically present in New York to transact business here within the meaning of \u00a7 302(a)(1), in \norder to trigger this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction, Defendants must have engaged in \u201cpurposeful \nactivities\u201d or \u201cvolitional acts\u201d through which they \u201cavailed [themselves] of the privilege of \nconducting activities\u201d within New York, \u201cthus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d \nChloe, 616 F.3d at 169 (internal references omitted): see also Fischbarg, 9  N.Y .3d  at 380 (\u201cNot \nall purposeful activity, however, constitutes a transaction of business within the meaning of \n\n                                      12 \n\nCPLR 302(a)(1).\u201d) (collecting cases).  Nothing in the First Amended Complaint or anything \nsubmitted by Arthur in connection with his opposition sufficiently alleges or shows that \nDefendants purposefully conducted business activity in New York using their website.  Belfar\u2019s \ndeclaration does not suggest that his purchase of Defendants\u2019 services was caused by or in any \nway connected to any efforts by Defendants, through the use of their website or other means, to \ntarget or solicit Belfar or New York customers generally.  Cf Chloe, 616 F.3d at 166 (finding \nsufficient record evidence that the defendant operated a website to offer products for sale to New \nYork consumers, permitted consumers to purchase such products, and facilitated the shipment of \nproducts into New York). \n      In their responses to interrogatories, Defendants represent that no sales are transacted \nthrough websites under their control.  See Postolski Decl. Ex. A.  Similarly, in his Declaration, \nBelfar does not represent that he used Defendants\u2019 website to purchase access to the April 2024 \nseminar\u2014which was held in Missouri, not New York\u2014or when or how he completed his \npurchase.*  Belfar simply states that he \u201cpaid [$3,300] to attend Raffi Andonian\u2019s [TV Seminar] \nin St. Louis, Missouri on April 26, 27, and 28, 2024,\u201d and that he had to travel from his home in \nNew York to do so.  Belfar Decl. 4] 2\u20143.  Although Arthur asserts that Defendants offer other \n\n      3 Personal jurisdiction must be ascertained as of the date this action was commenced. See Prince \ny. Intercept, 634 F. Supp. 3d 114, 128 (S.D.N-Y. 2022) (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction is determined at the time \nof service of the summons and complaint.\u201d); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d \n560, 569-70 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201cIn general jurisdiction cases, district courts should examine a defendant\u2019s \ncontacts with the forum state over a period that is reasonable under the circumstances\u2014up to and \nincluding the date the suit was filed\u2014to assess whether they satisfy the \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 \nstandard.\u201d) (internal footnote omitted).  Here, Arthur filed this action on April 19, 2024, see Dkt. No. 1, \nand Defendants sent waivers of service on April 22, 2024, see Dkt. Nos. 10 & 11.  Because Belfar does \nnot specify when he purchased access to the April 2024 seminar, which began on April 26, 2024, it is \npossible that, even assuming his transaction would otherwise sufficiently trigger personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants, his purchase occurred after this action was filed and the summons and Complaint were \nserved on Defendants, and therefore would not be a transaction sufficient to invoke this Court\u2019s personal \njurisdiction over Defendants. \n                                      13 \n\nservices on their website, such as daily \u201coffice hours\u201d or opportunities to consult by phone or e- \nmail, see Arthur Decl. Ex. B, there is no evidence that Belfar or any other New York resident \nused these services or that Defendants made any effort to solicit or target New York residents for \nthese services.  While \u00a7 302 is a \u201csingle act statute\u201d and \u201cproof of one transaction in New York \n[can be] sufficient to invoke jurisdiction,\u201d Am. Girl, 118 F.4th at 276 (internal references \nomitted), even viewing Belfar\u2019s Declaration in the light most favorable to Arthur, the nature of \nBelfar\u2019s transaction is an insufficient prima facie showing that Defendants purposefully \ntransacted business in New York.  See Green Earth Enter., LLC, 2025 WL 1425325, at *2: see, \ne.g., Royalty Network Inc. v. Dishant.com, LLC, 638 F. Supp. 2d 410, 421-22 (S.D.N-Y. 2009) \n(finding the defendants\u2019 sales to New York companies were insufficient to invoke personal \njurisdiction where the defendant solicited national corporate customers and did not specifically \ntarget New York audiences or users). \n      Moreover, Arthur has not sufficiently shown that there is \u201can articulable nexus, or a \nsubstantial relationship, between the claim|s] asserted and the action that occurred in New \nYork.\u201d  See Thackurdeen v. Duke Univ., 130 F. Supp. 3d 792, 802 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Best \nVan Lines, 490 F.3d at 246).  The fact that Defendants\u2019 website could have been used by a New \nYork resident, like Belfar, to access Defendants\u2019 services is incidental to the gravity and core \nelements of Arthur\u2019s breach of contract and other state law claims, which appear to lie in \nMissouri (where Defendants\u2019 held the April 2024 seminar and other events) or elsewhere (like \nNevada or Mexico, where Arthur held the seminars that Andonian attended).  See, e.g., id. \n(\u201c[T]he fact that contracts signed in New York served as \u2018a link in the chain of causation leading \nto plaintiff's claims\u2019 is not itself sufficient for purposes of section 302(a)(1).\u201d) (quoting Faherty \nv.

Supp. 142, 147 (S.D.N-Y. 1983)); Fischbarg, 9 N.Y.3d at 380 (\u201c[W]e have \n\n                                      14 \n\nheld that \u2018merely telephon[ing] a single order\u2019 to New York requesting a shipment of goods to \nanother state . . . do[es] not support CPLR 302(a)(1) jurisdiction.\u201d) (citing Parke-Bernet \nGalleries v.   Franklyn, 26  N.Y .2d  13, 17 (1970)). \n     Similarly, the various social media posts depicting Defendants in connection with New \nYork-related landmarks and New York Life Insurance do not demonstrate that Defendants were \npurposefully selling their services in New York.  See Opp. Ex. A; see also Postolski Decl. Ex. A \n(Andonian indicating that Arthur coordinated the NASDAQ billboard feature of Defendants\u2019 \nbusiness in Times Square).  To the extent these posts constitute advertisements for Defendants\u2019 \nservices, \u201c[a|dvertisements are [only] sufficient to show that the defendant conduct|ed] business \nin the forum state \u20181f the advertisements are supplemented by business transactions occurring in \nthe state .. . or [are] accompanied by a fair measure of the defendant\u2019s permanence and \ncontinuity in New York which establishes a New York presence.\u2019\u201d A/l-Ahmed v. Twitter, Inc., \n553 F. Supp. 3d 118, 126 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Virgin Enters. Ltd. v. \nVirgin Eyes LAC, No. 08-CV-08564 (LAP), 2009 WL 3241529, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. Sept. 30, \n2009)).  In light of the limited nature and quality of Belfar\u2019s single transaction to attend \nDefendants\u2019 seminar in Missouri, as described above, Defendants\u2019 social media posts, either \nindividually or together with the representations in the Belfar Declaration and First Amended \nComplaint, do not support a prima facie showing that Defendants had a sufficiently fair measure \nof permanence and continuity in New York to trigger this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction.  See, \ne.g.,  \u25a1\u25a1 \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 Grp., Inc., 828 F. Supp. 2d at 566 (finding that the defendant\u2019s online advertising, \neven if directed at New York residents, was insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction where \nthe plaintiff did not allege \u201cany other facts from which the Court can infer that the [dJefendant \npurposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in New York\u201d).  Moreover,\n\nArthur has, again, not even attempted to articulate any nexus or substantial relationship between \nthe social media posts and the claims asserted in the First Amended Complaint. \n      Accordingly, Arthur has not sufficiently demonstrated that Defendants transacted \nbusiness in New York to subject them to this Court\u2019s specific personal jurisdiction. \n                 ii.     Defendants Did Not Commit a Tortious Act Within New York \n      Finally, CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(2) authorizes the Court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a \nnon-domiciliary who \u201ccommits a tortious act within the state.\u201d  CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(2).  This \nprovision \u201creaches only tortious acts performed by a defendant who was physically present in \nNew York when he performed the wrongful act.\u201d Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d \n25, 28 (2d Cir. 1997). \n      In his opposition, Arthur argues that \u201cDefendants have both transacted within the state \nand committed a tortious act against [him] within the State of New York[,]\u201d but fails to articulate \nhow Defendants committed any purported tortious act in New York.  See Opp. at 19.  In the First \nAmended Complaint, Arthur alleges no facts that support a finding that a tortious act was \ncommitted in New York, see FAC \u00a7 11\u2014as discussed above, Andonian attended Arthur\u2019s \nseminars and signed the Seminar Agreement in Nevada and Mexico, and Andonian\u2019s own \nseminars were hosted in Missouri.  Andonian taking some photographs in New York that were \nlater used in social media posts advertising his business does not qualify as a \u201ctortious act\u201d \nsufficient to fall within Section 302(a)(2), and Arthur does not articulate any basis on which it \ncould. \n      Accordingly, Arthur has not demonstrated that Defendants committed a tort in New York \nsufficient to invoke this Court\u2019s specific personal jurisdiction.* \n\n      * Under CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(3), a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary who \n\u201ccommits a tortious act without the state causing injury to [a] person . . . within the state[.]\u201d  CPLR \u00a7 \n                                      16 \n\n                            *      *      *      * \n     Because the Court concludes that it lacks a lawful basis to exercise personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants, the Court need not consider any of the other grounds raised by Defendants for \ndismissal of this action.  See, e.g., Creative Photographers, Inc., 763 F. Supp. 3d at 630; Marcus \nv. Archer, No. 19-CV-07099 (JPO), 2020 WL 4937353, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2020). \n     Furthermore, the Court denies Arthur leave to amend because repleading in this District \ncannot cure this substantive jurisdictional defect, and thus, any amendment would be futile.  See, \ne.g., Smith v. United States, 554 F. App\u2019x 30, 32 (2d. Cir. 2013); Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d \n99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201c\u2018[A] futile request to replead should be denied.\u201d).  Nothing in this \nOpinion bars Arthur from re-filing his claims in a court that can exercise personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants, if he chooses. \n                               CONCLUSION \n     For the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) is GRANTED.  The \nClerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate Dkt. No. 24 and CLOSE this case. \n\nDated: August 1, 2025 \n    New York, New York \n                                            SO ORDERED. \n\n                                               United States District Judge \n\n302(a)(3).  Here, Arthur does not assert or argue that Defendants committed a tortious act outside of New \nYork, which caused him injury within New York. Accordingly, the Court does not analyze or determine \nwhether Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 302(a)(3).  See United States v. Lawrence, \n553 F. Supp. 3d 131, 134.1 (S.D.N-Y. 2021) (\u201cCourts need not entertain an argument that was not \nme    (internal references omitted); Hudson v. Cnty. of Dutchess, 51 F. Supp. 3d 357, 378 (S.D.N-Y. \n\n                                     17",

Arthur claimed that Andonian, who attended his seminars, stole his \"Mathematical Formula for Getting on TV\" and used it to offer similar services to Arthur's clients. The key legal issue is whether the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants, who are based in Missouri. The court ruled in favor of the defendants, dismissing the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\n**Key legal issue:** Personal jurisdiction\n**Type of injury:** Misappropriation of proprietary business information\n**Outcome:** Case dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction"
