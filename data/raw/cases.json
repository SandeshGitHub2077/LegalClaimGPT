Once there, the\n\nRobertses allowed Stout to drive their all-terrain vehicle (\"ATV\"). While driving the ATV,\n\nStout made her way off the Robertses' property and onto a public roadway, King Pike\n\nRoad. Upon entering onto King Pike Road, Stout lost control of the ATV, veered off the\n\nroad, and crashed into a utility pole. The accident resulted in Stout's death. Stout was 16\n\nyears old at the time of her passing.\n\n       {\u00b6 3} On October 23, 2024, Donahue-Jones filed a complaint against the\n\nRobertses. Within her complaint, Donahue-Jones alleged two causes of action; one a\n\nsurvivorship action and the other a wrongful death action, both of which were based on a\n\nnegligence theory of liability. To support this theory, Donahue-Jones alleged the\n\nRobertses had acted negligently, intentionally, knowingly, willfully, wantonly, recklessly,\n\nand unlawfully by, among other things, entrusting and failing to supervise, warn, or\n\nmanage Stout knowing that she was neither competent nor experienced enough to drive\n\nthe ATV on the day of the accident.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} On November 25, 2024, the Robertses moved the trial court to dismiss\n\nDonahue-Jones' complaint. The Robertses' motion was filed pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6),\n\nwhich authorizes a trial court to dismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim upon which\n\n\n1. Pursuant to Loc.R. 6(A), we sua sponte remove this appeal from the accelerated calendar for purposes\nof issuing this opinion.\n\n\n                                                   -2-\n\f                                                                 Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nrelief could be granted. To support their motion, the Robertses argued that Donahue-\n\nJones's theory of liability was, as a matter of law, barred by the primary assumption of\n\nrisk doctrine. The trial court agreed and, on February 25, 2025, granted the Robertses'\n\nmotion to dismiss. In so holding, the trial court determined that \"[t]he doctrine of primary\n\nassumption of risk applies, and thus the duty element of negligence is not established as\n\na matter of law.\" The trial court reached this decision upon finding the Robertses were\n\nmerely the owners of the ATV and \"were not participants in the recreational or sport[ing]\n\nactivity; they were not driving nor riding the ATVs in question,\" thereby allowing the\n\nRobertses to fall outside of the exception to the primary assumption of risk doctrine for\n\nreckless and intentional conduct.\n\n        Donahue-Jones' Appeal and Single Assignment of Error for Review\n\n       {\u00b6 5} On March 27, 2025, Donahue-Jones filed a notice of appeal. Following\n\nbriefing, on July 3, 2025, Donahue-Jones' appeal was submitted to this court for\n\nconsideration. Donahue-Jones' appeal now properly before this court for decision,\n\nDonahue-Jones has raised one assignment of error for review. In her single assignment\n\nof error, Donahue-Jones argues the trial court erred by granting the Civ.R. 12(B)(6)\n\nmotion to dismiss filed by the Robertses in this case. To support this contention, Donahue-\n\nJones argues that (1) the primary assumption of the risk doctrine does not bar her from\n\nasserting the Robertses owed a duty to Stout, and that, (2) an exception to the primary\n\nassumption of risk doctrine applies because she alleged in her complaint that the\n\nRobertses had acted, at the very least, recklessly in causing Stout's injuries and\n\nsubsequent death. We find no merit to either of Donahue-Jones' claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f                                                                  Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\n                           Civ.R. 12(B)(6) Motion to Dismiss\n\n       {\u00b6 6} \"A Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of a complaint.\"\n\nPitzer v. Wilmington, 2024-Ohio-5141, \u00b6 9 (12th Dist.). The rule does this by authorizing\n\nthe trial court to dismiss a complaint if it \"fails to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted.\" Rossi v. Atrium Med. Ctr., 2023-Ohio-984, \u00b6 8 (12th Dist.). Thus, \"[a] motion\n\nmade pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) only determines whether the pleader's allegations set\n\nforth an actionable claim.\" Ward v. Graue, 2012-Ohio-760, \u00b6 9 (12th Dist.). This\n\nnecessarily means that the trial court may not use a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss \"to\n\nsummarily review the merits of the cause of action.\" Home Builders Assn. of Dayton &\n\nMiami Valley v. Lebanon, 2004-Ohio-4526, \u00b6 8 (12th Dist.). Rather, \"[t]he trial court may\n\nlook only to the complaint to determine whether the allegations are legally sufficient to\n\nstate a claim.\" A.W. v. Kircher, 2024-Ohio-2115, \u00b6 24 (12th Dist.). When making this\n\ninquiry, \"'all the factual allegations of the complaint must be taken as true and all\n\nreasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party.'\" Simpson v.\n\nMoreland, 2024-Ohio-1728, \u00b6 6 (12th Dist.), quoting Byrd v. Faber, 57 Ohio St.3d 56, 60\n\n(1991). Therefore, for a trial court to dismiss a complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), it must\n\nappear beyond a reasonable doubt from the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set\n\nof facts that would entitle the plaintiff to recovery. Gordon v. Mt. Carmel Farms, LLC,\n\n2021-Ohio-1233, \u00b6 18 (12th Dist.).\n\n                              De Novo Standard of Review\n\n       {\u00b6 7} An appeal of a trial court's decision on a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion presents a\n\nquestion of law. Amburgey v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 2001-Ohio-8695, 2001 Ohio App.\n\nLEXIS 4730, *4 (12th Dist. Oct. 22, 2001). Because it presents a question of law, we\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f                                                                  Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nreview de novo a trial court's decision to either grant or deny a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss. Ditech Fin. LLC v. Ebbing, 2019-Ohio-2077, \u00b6 22 (12th Dist.). Application of the\n\nprimary assumption of risk doctrine is also a question of law that this court reviews de\n\nnovo. Cameron v. Univ. of Toledo, 2018-Ohio-979, \u00b6 46 (10th Dist.) \"Under this standard,\n\nwe examine the legal questions with fresh eyes, giving no deference to the trial court's\n\nconclusions.\" Smith v. Mercy Health-Clermont Hosp., LLC, 2025-Ohio-1590, \u00b6 13 (12th\n\nDist.).\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n          {\u00b6 8} \"Ohio is a notice-pleading state.\" Maternal Grandmother v. Hamilton Cty.\n\nDept. of Job & Family Servs., 2021-Ohio-4096, \u00b6 10. \"This means that outside of a few\n\nspecific circumstances, such as claims involving fraud or mistake, see Civ.R. 9(B), a party\n\nwill not be expected to plead a claim with particularity.\" Doe v. Greenville City Schools,\n\n2022-Ohio-4618, \u00b6 7. \"Rather, 'a short and plain statement of the claim,' Civ.R. 8(A), will\n\ntypically do.\" Id. However, \"even under Ohio's notice-pleading standard, a cause of action\n\nmust be factually supported and courts need not accept bare assertions of legal\n\nconclusions.\" Enduring Wellness, LLC v. Roizen, 2020-Ohio-3180, \u00b6 24 (8th Dist.). This\n\nis because, as is now well established, \"unsupported legal conclusions, even when cast\n\nas factual assertions, are not presumed true for purposes of a motion to dismiss\" for failing\n\nto state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). State ex rel.\n\nRoush v. Hickson, 2024-Ohio-4741, \u00b6 8. Therefore, a complaint that offers nothing more\n\nthan labels and conclusions or formulaic recitations of the elements of a cause of action\n\nwill not do, nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders merely naked assertions devoid of\n\nfurther factual enhancement. Sultaana v. Horseshoe Casino, 2015-Ohio-4083, \u00b6 12 (8th\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\f                                                                   Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nDist.).\n\n          {\u00b6 9} As noted above, Donahue-Jones' complaint alleged two causes of action\n\nagainst the Robertses; one a survivorship action and the other a wrongful death action,\n\nboth of which were based on a negligence theory of liability. \"To establish a negligence\n\nclaim, the plaintiff must demonstrate (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care,\n\n(2) the defendant breached the duty of care, and (3) as a direct and proximate result of\n\nthe defendant's breach, the plaintiff was injured.\" Oliphant v. AWP, Inc., 2020-Ohio-229,\n\n\u00b6 32 (12th Dist.). However, under the primary assumption of the risk doctrine, an individual\n\nwho engages in a recreational activity, such as riding an ATV, \"assumes the ordinary\n\nrisks of that activity and cannot recover for injuries unless the defendant's actions were\n\neither reckless or intentional.\" Young v. Eagle, 2017-Ohio-7211, \u00b6 18 (12th Dist.).\n\n\"'Reckless conduct is characterized by the conscious disregard of or indifference to a\n\nknown or obvious risk of harm to another that is unreasonable under the circumstances\n\nand is substantially greater than negligent conduct.'\" Baldwin v. Church of God of Trenton,\n\n2024-Ohio-1726, \u00b6 38 (12th Dist.), quoting Anderson v. Massillon, 2012-Ohio-5711, \u00b6 34.\n\n\"The rationale is that certain risks are so inherent in some activities that the risk of injury\n\nis unavoidable.\" Crace v. Kent State Univ., 2009-Ohio-6898, \u00b6 13 (10th Dist.)\n\n          {\u00b6 10} \"Losing control and flipping an ATV is a foreseeable and customary risk\n\nassociated with the activity of driving or riding on an ATV.\" Curtis v. Schmid, 2008-Ohio-\n\n5239, \u00b6 56 (5th Dist.); see also Ochall v. McNamer, 2016-Ohio-8493, \u00b6 50 (10th Dist.)\n\n(\"the risk that a go-kart may veer off the track and strike any object present nearby is a\n\nrisk inherent to go-karting\"). \"Primary assumption of the risk is essentially a principle of\n\nno duty, or no negligence.\" West v. Devendra, 2012-Ohio-6092, \u00b6 14 (7th Dist.).\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\f                                                                  Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nTherefore, because \"[p]rimary assumption of the risk means that a defendant owes no\n\nduty whatsoever to the plaintiff,\" Horvath v. Ish, 2012-Ohio-5333, \u00b6 18, \"a successful\n\nprimary assumption of risk defense means that the duty element of negligence is not\n\nestablished as a matter of law,\" thus preventing the plaintiff \"from even making a prima\n\nfacie case.\" Gallagher v. Cleveland Browns Football Co., 1996-Ohio-320, \u00b6 15.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} Given these principles, for Donahue-Jones to overcome the Robertses'\n\nmotion to dismiss in this case, Donahue-Jones needed to allege sufficient facts in her\n\ncomplaint that if taken as true, and with all reasonable inferences drawn in her favor,\n\nwould allow for recovery against the Robertses. What is more, because a successful\n\nprimary assumption of the risk defense prevents the plaintiff from making even a prima\n\nfacie case, such factual allegations made by Donahue-Jones would need to demonstrate\n\nthat the Robertses had acted, at the very least, recklessly in causing Stout's injuries and\n\nsubsequent death. But, upon a review of Donahue-Jones' complaint, Donahue-Jones\n\nalleged no facts that would support such a contention. This is because, rather than factual\n\nallegations, Donahue-Jones' complaint consists of unsupported legal conclusions.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} This includes, for example, Donahue-Jones' making the blanket conclusion\n\nthat the Robertses had acted recklessly by entrusting their ATV to Stout knowing that she\n\nwas neither competent nor experienced enough to drive the ATV on the day of the\n\naccident. See Luke v. Short Creek Joint Fire District, 2025-Ohio-203, \u00b6 103 (7th Dist.)\n\n(\"[p]rimary assumption of the risk applies even when the participant is 'entirely ignorant'\n\nof the activity's risk\"). This also includes Donahue-Jones conclusively alleging that the\n\nRobertses had acted recklessly by failing to supervise Stout while she was driving their\n\nATV prior to when Stout lost control of the ATV and collided into a utility pole. Allegations\n\n\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\f                                                                   Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nof this sort, which are nothing more than mere legal conclusions, are insufficient to\n\novercome a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failing to state a claim upon which relief\n\ncould be granted. See Harper v. Weltman, Weinberg & Reis Co., L.P.A., 2019-Ohio-3093,\n\n\u00b6 33 (8th Dist.) (\"[L]egal conclusions are not considered admitted and are not sufficient to\n\nwithstand a motion to dismiss.\"). This is because, as noted above, \"unsupported legal\n\nconclusions are not entitled to any presumption of truth and are not sufficient to survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss\" filed pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Maternal Grandmother, 2021-Ohio-\n\n4096 at \u00b6 29 (DeWine, J., concurring in judgment only).\n\n       {\u00b6 13} That Stout was just 16 years old at the time of her passing is immaterial for\n\nit is well established that \"the age or maturity of an injured party is immaterial for purposes\n\nof the primary assumption of risk doctrine.\" Young, 2017-Ohio-7211 at \u00b6 25 (trial court did\n\nnot err by concluding that a four-year-old was barred from recovering against the\n\ndefendants based on the primary assumption of risk doctrine). That Stout was not wearing\n\na helmet at the time of the accident does not alter this outcome. This is because, as is\n\nequally well established, the risk of serious physical harm and/or death are foreseeable,\n\ncommon, and customary risks of operating an ATV without a helmet. See Stehlik v.\n\nRhoads, 2002 WI 73, \u00b6 28 (noting that \"the risks associated with ATVs are well-known\"\n\nand that \"an ordinarily prudent person knows or reasonably should know that wearing a\n\nsafety helmet while operating or riding an ATV protects against serious head injury\").\n\n       {\u00b6 14} In sum, when reviewing Donahue-Jones' complaint, there are no allegations\n\nhere of an unassumed risk. Stout's injuries and subsequent death, while tragic, is an\n\nordinary example of the risk inherent to driving or riding on an ATV. Therefore, finding no\n\nerror in the trial court's decision to grant the Robertses' motion to dismiss in this case,\n\n\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f                                                                     Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nDonahue-Jones' single assignment of error lacks merit and is overruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} In so holding, we find it necessary to note that, contrary to the trial court's\n\ndecision in this case, this court has addressed and specifically rejected the argument that\n\nthe primary assumption of risk doctrine\u2014which is also known as the recreational liability\n\nexemption\u2014bars recovery only from a defendant who participates in the activity. Whitaker\n\nv. Davis, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 287 (12th Dist. Jan. 27, 1997). In reaching this decision,\n\nwe concluded that the rationale underlying the recreational liability exemption could be\n\nextended to non-participants because it would be illogical to require evidence of reckless\n\nor intentional conduct to recover against participants in the activity, yet allow recovery\n\nagainst non-participant defendants based on the lower standard of negligence. Id. at *8-\n\n9. Therefore, based on this reasoning, this court held that when a party is injured during\n\na recreational activity, he or she must demonstrate that the defendant acted recklessly or\n\nintentionally. Id. at *9.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} This court has since declined an appellant's invitation to reconsider this\n\nholding. See Young, 2017-Ohio-7211 at \u00b6 23. In so doing, this court stated:\n\n               The recreational activity exemption is merely a specific\n               iteration of primary assumption of the risk to apply. . . [T]he\n               rationale of primary assumption of risk in the context of the\n               recreational activity exemption is that there are inherent risks\n               in certain recreational activities such that injury may be\n               inevitable. If a person voluntarily engages in such an activity\n               they consent to those risks. The law therefore requires more\n               culpability \u2014 reckless or intentional conduct \u2014 before liability\n               will attach. Thus, it is the plaintiff's status as a participant or\n               spectator in a recreational activity that determines whether the\n               rule applies and not the defendant's status as a participant.\nId.\n\n       {\u00b6 17} In reaching this decision, this court further noted that, while the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court has not had the opportunity to weigh in on this precise issue, \"other courts\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f                                                                  Madison CA2025-03-010\n\n\nof appeal have extended the primary assumption of risk doctrine to non-participant\n\ndefendants.\" Id. at \u00b6 24, citing as support Ochall v. McNamer, 2016-Ohio-8493 (10th\n\nDist.); Drury v. Blackston, 2015-Ohio-4725 (3d Dist.); Curtis v. Schmid, 2008-Ohio-5239\n\n(5th Dist.); Santho v. BSA, 2006-Ohio-3656 (10th Dist.); Rees v.

(Super. Ct. No. SCD301504)\n\n MARKUS EICHHORST,\n\n           Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County,\nJoan P. Weber, Judge. Affirmed.\n         Lisa A. Kopelman, under appointment by the Court of Appeal, for\nDefendant and Appellant.\n         No appearance by Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\f      Following a jury trial, Markus Eichhorst was convicted of vandalism\n\ncausing more than $400 in damages. (Pen. Code,1 \u00a7 594, subds. (a) & (b)(1);\ncount 3.) The jury was unable to reach a verdict on counts 1 and 2\u2014charges\nof child abuse (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a); count 1) and assault with force likely to\nproduce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4); count 2)\u2014and the trial court\ndeclared a mistrial as to each count. Eichhorst subsequently pleaded guilty\nto count 2 in exchange for dismissal of count 1. The court sentenced him to\ntwo years formal probation with conditions that included 180 days in county\njail and payment of direct restitution, along with other fines and fees.\n      Eichhorst filed a timely notice of appeal. Appellate counsel asks this\ncourt to conduct an independent review of the record for reversible error\nunder People v. Wende (1979) 25 Cal.3d 436. We offered Eichhorst the\nopportunity to file his own brief on appeal, but he did not respond.\n             FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      The charges against Eichhorst arose out of what can be colloquially\nreferred to as a \u201croad rage\u201d incident. To provide context for the charges at\ntrial, the jury heard evidence that, following several miles of erratic driving,\nEichhorst intentionally collided with another vehicle. Inside the other\nvehicle were Lance Tamyo and his 12-year-old son (the victim). After the\naccident, both vehicles pulled over and Tamyo called 911.\n      While waiting for the police to arrive, Eichhorst approached Tamyo\u2019s\nvehicle twice. He first went to confront Tamyo and became angry when\nTamyo blamed him for the collision. When he returned to Tamyo\u2019s vehicle a\nsecond time, Eichhorst tried to open the front passenger-side door, where the\nvictim was sitting, while shouting and hitting the car with metal pliers. He\neventually broke through the glass window and punched the victim before\n\n\n1     Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n                                        2\n\freaching into the car to grab him. Once the victim fled to the backseat,\nEichhorst attempted to open the rear passenger-side door and continued\nhitting the vehicle with the pliers until he heard sirens approaching.\n      Police arrived and detained Eichhorst. A police officer testified there\nwas blood on both the broken car window and Eichhorst\u2019s hands.\n                                DISCUSSION\n      Appellate counsel filed a Wende brief, requesting the court\nindependently review the record for error. In line with Anders v. California\n(1967) 386 U.S. 738, counsel identified a potentially arguable issue to assist\nwith our review: Whether the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the\njury with CALCRIM No. 3404.\n      The identified issue does not rise to the level of arguable issues for\nreversal on appeal because the request for, and denial of, CALCRIM No. 3404\ndid not concern the vandalism charge\u2014the only charge of which the jury\nconvicted Eichhorst.\n      We have independently reviewed the entire record as mandated by\nWende and Anders and found no arguable issues. Competent counsel has\nrepresented Eichhorst on this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\f                            DISPOSITION\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                          DATO, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\nO\u2019ROURKE, Acting P.

A second procedure followed\n\nin August 2016. After some difficulty eating and speaking, a different doctor\n\ndiagnosed Belisle with nerve damage. She sued Proliance Surgeons, Inc.,\n\nDr. Seely, and several others in April 2020. Several parties were dismissed on\n\nsummary judgment and the case proceeded to trial in November 2023. The jury\n\nreturned a defense verdict.\n\n       Belisle appeals, asserting that the trial court improperly dismissed claims\n\nagainst Dr. Roger Zundel on summary judgment; improperly denied Belisle\u2019s\n\nmotion to shorten time; erred in limiting Belisle\u2019s testimony about her medical\n\nconditions, erred in allowing late-disclosed expert testimony, and erred in\n\nexcluding Dr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis. Belisle also contends that\n\nthe evidence is insufficient to support the jury verdict. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n                                     Background\n\n       In April 2016, Stephanie Belisle sought care from otolaryngologist\n\nDr. Daniel Seely for a recurring tonsil infection. After taking a patient history and\n\nperforming a physical exam, Dr. Seely determined that she was a candidate for a\n\ntonsillectomy with a possible adenoidectomy. Dr. Seely documented discussing\n\nthe nature of this surgery with Belisle, including its risks, benefits, and\n\n\n                                           2\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/3\n\n\nalternatives. Belisle chose to proceed with the surgery.\n\n       The day of the surgery, the medical team provided Belisle with a series of\n\ndocuments including an informed consent form. The informed consent form\n\nlisted nerve injury as a possible risk. Belisle signed the informed consent form\n\nand Dr. Seely performed the procedure.\n\n                                Postoperative Care\n\n       Belisle\u2019s first postoperative appointment took place with Lori Hill, a\n\ncertified physician\u2019s assistant, about two weeks after the procedure. Belisle\n\ndescribed a difficult recovery because she took very little pain medication and\n\nwas having difficulty swallowing. She did note feeling significantly improved\n\notherwise. Hill informed Belisle that she was slightly behind in recovery because\n\nDr. Seely had to \u201cgo deeper\u201d than normal to remove the tissue but that she\n\nshould continue to improve.\n\n       Belisle saw Dr. Seely for her second postoperative visit, expressing\n\ngreater difficulty swallowing and a feeling of \u201ccatching\u201d on the right side of her\n\nthroat. Dr. Seely performed a flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, 1 which was\n\nunremarkable. He recommended a barium swallow study and speech pathology\n\nevaluation.\n\n       Belisle returned to Dr. Seely in June with continuing symptoms. Dr. Seely\n\nprescribed antibiotics and scheduled the barium swallow study. He also noted\n\n\n\n\n       1A flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy involves passing a small, flexible\ncamera through the nose and into the throat to view the larynx.\n\n                                          3\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/4\n\n\nthat \u201cif [Belisle] remain[ed] severely symptomatic, return to the operating room for\n\ndirect inspection of the tonsillar fossa may be considered.\u201d\n\n       In early July, Belisle saw Dr. Seely\u2019s colleague, Dr. Roger Zundel, while\n\nDr. Seely was out of town. She described severe difficulty swallowing and\n\nreported that she was completely unable to eat solid food. Dr. Zundel\u2019s physical\n\nexam was normal. Belisle saw Dr. Zundel a second time two weeks later, again\n\nreporting persistent gagging. Dr. Zundel expressed that he \u201cd[id] not have a solid\n\nexplanation\u201d for Belisle\u2019s experience. He recommended an esophagoscopy with\n\na biopsy but documented the need to discuss with Dr. Seely.\n\n                                  Second Surgery\n\n       Belisle underwent the esophagoscopy with biopsy when Dr. Seely\n\nreturned in August 2016. Before the procedure, the medical team again provided\n\nBelisle with an informed consent form. The form described the planned\n\nprocedure as a \u201cmicro direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, esophagoscopy\u201d to\n\nevaluate Belisle\u2019s difficulty swallowing. By signing the form, Belisle\n\nacknowledged that \u201cduring the course of the operation . . . unforeseen conditions\n\nmay necessitate additional or different procedures than those above set forth\u201d\n\nand authorized the performance of such procedures. She also acknowledged\n\nthat she had been informed of risks and complications, including nerve injury.\n\n       The consent form authorized Dr. Zundel, \u201cand/or such associates or\n\nassistants, including, if applicable, other physicians who will have an active\n\nprocess in the surgery\u201d to perform the procedure. Dr. Seely performed the\n\nprocedure and Dr. Zundel was not otherwise involved.\n\n\n                                         4\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/5\n\n\n       While performing the micro-laryngoscopy and esophagoscopy, Dr. Seely\n\nsaw a \u201ctiny amount of residual lymphoid tissue\u201d and performed a biopsy to\n\nremove it. Belisle\u2019s discomfort and difficulty swallowing continued after the\n\nsecond surgery.\n\n                                Additional Opinions\n\n       Following the second surgery, Belisle sought a number of additional\n\nopinions to determine the cause of her pain and dysphagia. Over the course of\n\nseveral months and with input from a variety of physicians and speech\n\npathologists, Belisle determined that she suffers from a hypercontractile\n\nesophagus. Also known as a \u201cjackhammer\u201d esophagus, the condition makes it\n\nextremely difficult to swallow. Belisle believed the condition to be the result of\n\nnerve damage from her adenotonsillectomy.\n\n                                     Initial Suit\n\n       In April 2020, Belisle sued 16 defendants, including Proliance Surgeons,\n\nInc. (Proliance), Dr. Seely, and Dr. Zundel, for alleged medical malpractice while\n\nperforming her tonsil surgeries. In addition to general negligence, Belisle\n\nasserted that Dr. Seely and Dr. Zundel failed to obtain informed consent for\n\neither procedure. Belisle also named nine other defendants, and their spouses\n\nand marital communities, who had never been involved in Belisle\u2019s care.\n\n       Belisle deposed Dr. Seely shortly after initiating the lawsuit. When asked\n\nwhen he retired, Dr. Seely informed Belisle that he \u201cwent out on medical leave\u201d in\n\nMay 2018. Belisle did not ask any further questions about that medical leave\n\nduring the deposition or any time thereafter.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/6\n\n\n       Dr. Seely also repeatedly defended his medical care, testifying that he\n\nperformed each procedure correctly and did not cut deeply enough to cause\n\nnerve injury as claimed. Dr. Seely cited his own experience performing the\n\nsurgery, as well as the pathology report confirming that he removed only tonsillar\n\ntissue with no additional muscle or nerve tissue, in support of his testimony.\n\nBelisle did not ask Dr. Seely about his informed consent procedures or pre-\n\nsurgery discussions. Belisle did not depose Dr. Zundel.\n\n                          Motions for Summary Judgment\n\n       Proliance first moved for summary judgment dismissal in December 2020.\n\nBringing three claims, Proliance asserted that Belisle failed to produce the\n\nnecessary expert testimony to sustain a medical malpractice claim, that Belisle\u2019s\n\nhusband\u2019s derivative loss of marital consortium claim failed as a result, and that\n\nBelisle did not allege facts that could give rise to any action against the nine\n\nlisted defendants who were not involved in her care.\n\n       Proliance voluntarily withdrew the expert testimony claim in January but\n\ncontinued forward with the other two claims. The trial court denied the motion as\n\nto the loss of marital consortium but granted summary judgment dismissing the\n\nindividual claims against the nine other doctors at Proliance, their spouses, and\n\nmarital communities.\n\n       After setting a trial date and working out the details of in-person versus\n\nZoom attendance, Proliance moved for summary judgment a second time in\n\nJune 2023. Proliance contended that Belisle lacked sufficient evidence to\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/7\n\n\nestablish a prima facie case for medical negligence, loss of consortium, or failure\n\nto secure informed consent.\n\n       Opposing summary judgment, Belisle produced declarations from\n\nDr. Michael Kaplan and Dr. Matt Hershcovitch, both otolaryngologists, criticizing\n\nDr. Seely and Dr. Zundel\u2019s informed consent process. At argument on the issue,\n\nthe court acknowledged that it was difficult to piece together Belisle\u2019s evidence\n\nagainst Dr. Zundel but denied the entirety of the motion for summary judgment.\n\n       Dr. Zundel moved for reconsideration on the issue of informed consent\n\nbecause, as he did not perform the procedure at issue, he believed he had no\n\nlegal duty to obtain informed consent. Belisle responded that because\n\nDr. Zundel was \u201cin the same practice\u201d as Dr. Seely, handled the informed\n\nconsent forms, and appeared on the consent forms, Dr. Zundel was liable for any\n\ninjuries associated with the second procedure. The trial court disagreed and\n\ngranted Dr. Zundel\u2019s motion for reconsideration, dismissing the informed consent\n\nclaims against him.\n\n       In September 2023, Belisle moved for summary judgment. Belisle argued\n\nthat no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of her medical bills. But she included no legal authority, analysis, or\n\nargument as to why she was entitled to a dispositive ruling on the issue. Five\n\ndays later, Belisle moved to shorten time on her motion for summary judgment,\n\nacknowledging that the motion when filed fell outside the court\u2019s case schedule\n\norder deadline for dispositive motions. She argued that, as the medical bills were\n\nuncontested, shortening time was appropriate. Dr. Seely opposed Belisle\u2019s\n\n\n                                         7\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/8\n\n\nmotion to shorten time, clarifying that he did in fact contest medical causation\n\nand that causation is central to the reasonableness of medical care and\n\nnecessity of any resulting medical bills.\n\n       The trial court denied Belisle\u2019s motion to shorten time, finding that she\n\nprovided no legal authority, argument, or explanation as to why she could not\n\nhave filed the summary judgment motion within the deadline. The trial court did\n\nnot rule on her motion for summary judgment, leaving the question of whether\n\nthe medical bills would be admitted to be determined at trial.\n\n                              Other Pre-Trial Motions\n\n       In the days leading up to trial, the court heard argument on the remaining\n\npre-trial motions that had not been addressed by either motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n       Informing the court that Dr. Seely had been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s\n\ndisease in 2018, Proliance requested accommodations for medicine and rest\n\nbreaks. Proliance also requested that the court instruct the jury about his\n\ncondition so that they would not speculate about Dr. Seely\u2019s visible tremor.\n\nBelisle initially agreed with Proliance\u2019s request. After a recess, however, Belisle\n\nstated that \u201c[plaintiff\u2019s counsel] just found out about [the diagnosis]\u201d and claimed\n\nthat Dr. Seely\u2019s disease must have existed at the time of Belisle\u2019s procedure.\n\nInstead of having the court simply inform the jury of Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis, Belisle\n\nindicated that she intended to argue it resulted in her injury. Belisle\n\nacknowledged that she did not have an expert to testify about the progression of\n\nParkinson\u2019s disease or any evidence that Dr. Seely\u2019s eventual diagnosis\n\n\n                                            8\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/9\n\n\nimpacted either surgery. Given that lack of evidence, and the risk of leading the\n\njury to speculate, the court excluded any testimony or argument that Dr. Seely\u2019s\n\ndiagnosis was implicated in the alleged malpractice.\n\n       Proliance also moved in limine asking the trial court to preclude Belisle\n\nfrom testifying about her mental and emotional pain and suffering. The trial court\n\ndenied the motion but reserved ruling on a similar motion in limine to exclude\n\nnon-physician testimony on medical facts, standards of care, or causation. The\n\ncourt determined that Belisle, a former trauma nurse, may have been able to\n\ntestify to some medical facts, and therefore, defense counsel needed to object at\n\nthe time of questioning.\n\n       The trial court then addressed Belisle\u2019s request to admit the medical bills\n\nat issue as a group, requiring Belisle to submit each bill as an individual exhibit.\n\n                                        Trial\n\n       The case proceeded to trial in November 2023. Belisle testified over the\n\ncourse of multiple days about her medical history, diagnoses and treatment\n\noptions, and remaining symptoms. The court only limited Belisle\u2019s medical\n\ntestimony on hearsay or foundational objections.\n\n       Dr. Seely testified in defense of his medical care and informed consent\n\nprocess. He unequivocally denied cutting deep enough to injure Belisle\u2019s nerves\n\nand stated that he complied with the standard of care. Both parties presented\n\ntestimony from multiple experts.\n\n       Belisle\u2019s otolaryngologist experts testified that they believed Dr. Seely cut\n\ntoo deep and injured Belisle\u2019s vagus nerve. Neither described how the nerve\n\n\n                                          9\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/10\n\n\ninjury could have occurred, nor did they assert Dr. Seely breached the standard\n\nof care during the second procedure.\n\n          Dr. Seely\u2019s otolaryngologist expert, Dr. Dinesh Chhetry, testified that\n\nDr. Seely did not breach the standard of care for either procedure. He\n\nspecifically explained that to injure the vagus nerve, Dr. Seely would have had to\n\ncut through muscle and fat beyond the tonsillar tissue, of which no evidence\n\nexists.\n\n          Over the course of the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel consistently arrived late and\n\nbudgeted time poorly. The court repeatedly admonished counsel and articulated\n\nthat time management, not the unwieldiness of the medical bill exhibits, caused\n\nthe drawn-out proceedings.\n\n          Following extensive testimony from both parties, the jury determined in an\n\n11 to 1 verdict that Dr. Seely had not been negligent in either procedure and did\n\nnot fail to obtain informed consent. Belisle appeals.\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                                   Summary Judgment\n\n          Belisle asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\ndismissing her informed consent claim against Dr. Zundel. She also asserts that\n\nthe trial court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment concerning the\n\nadmission of medical bills as reasonable and necessary. To the former,\n\nProliance contends that summary judgment is appropriate because Dr. Zundel\n\nhad no legal duty to obtain informed consent for a procedure he did not perform.\n\nTo the latter, Proliance maintains that the trial court appropriately denied Belisle\u2019s\n\n\n                                            10\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/11\n\n\nmotion to shorten time and did not rule on her motion for summary judgment.\n\nWe conclude the trial court did not err.\n\n       We review a summary judgment order de novo, viewing the facts and\n\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n\nWatkins v. ESA Mgmt., LLC, 30 Wn. App. 2d 916, 923, 547 P.3d 271 (2024).\n\nSummary judgment is proper when no genuine issue of material fact exists and\n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Watkins, 30 Wn.\n\nApp.2d at 923.\n\n       We review a ruling on a motion to shorten time for a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Hood Canal Sand & Gravel, LLC v. Goldmark, 195 Wn. App. 284,\n\n295, 381 P.3d 95 (2016). A trial court manifestly abuses its discretion if its\n\ndecision is manifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds or reasons.\n\nState v. Bellerouche, 33 Wn. App. 877, 889-90, 565 P.3d 604 (2025).\n\n       1. Informed Consent\n\n       Belisle states that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\ndismissal of the informed consent claim against Dr. Zundel because a genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists as to whether she gave informed consent to a\n\nsecond tonsillectomy by Dr. Seely. Because Belisle conflates the dismissal of\n\nthe informed consent claim against Dr. Zundel with the ultimate jury\n\ndetermination in favor of Dr. Seely, and Dr. Zundel had no legal responsibility for\n\ndamages because of a lack of informed consent for a procedure he did not\n\nperform, we disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/12\n\n\n       Under the doctrine of informed consent, a health care provider has a duty\n\nto disclose relevant facts about the patient\u2019s condition and the proposed course\n\nof treatment to allow the patient to make an informed health care decision.\n\nDavies v. MultiCare Health Sys., 199 Wn.2d 608, 616, 510 P.3d 346 (2022). The\n\ndoctrine rests on the presumption that patients have a right to make decisions\n\nabout their medical treatment. Backlund v. Univ. of Wash., 137 Wn.2d 651, 663,\n\n975 P.2d 950 (1999). A patient may recover for a physician\u2019s failure to provide\n\ninformed consent even if the diagnosis or treatment were not negligent.\n\nBacklund, 137 Wn.2d at 663.\n\n       To prove a breach of the duty to secure informed consent, a plaintiff must\n\nestablish that: (1) the health care provider failed to inform the patient of a\n\nmaterial fact relating to the treatment; (2) the patient consented to treatment\n\nwithout being aware of or fully informed of such material fact; (3) a reasonably\n\nprudent person under similar circumstances would not have consented to the\n\ntreatment if provided with that material fact; and (4) the treatment in question\n\nproximately caused injury. RCW 7.70.050.\n\n       But health care providers do not carry equal informed consent obligations.\n\nSee Alexander v. Gonser, 42 Wn. App. 234, 238, 711 P.2d 347 (1985) (not every\n\nentity and individual that falls within the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d has\n\nequal informed consent obligations). \u201cTo provide for equal informed consent\n\nobligations as to every person and entity falling within the definition [of \u2018health\n\ncare provider\u2019] would not be justified.\u201d Howell v. Spokane & Inland Empire Blood\n\nBank, 114 Wn.2d 42, 55, 785 P.2d 815 (1990). And RCW 7.70.050 limits\n\n\n                                          12\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/13\n\n\ninformed consent claims to treatment situations. Gomez v. Sauerwein, 180\n\nWn.2d 610, 617, 331 P.3d 19 (2014).\n\n       Belisle claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nbecause the consent form did not mention Dr. Seely and purported to provide\n\nDr. Zundel consent to perform only a laryngoscopy (with possible biopsy) and\n\nesophagoscopy. This conflates a number of different issues.\n\n       To begin, the trial court granted summary judgment dismissing only the\n\ninformed consent claim against Dr. Zundel following a motion for reconsideration.\n\nOn appeal, Belisle does not argue that Dr. Zundel failed to obtain informed\n\nconsent to perform the procedure. Rather, she seems to assert that Dr. Zundel\n\nfailed to obtain informed consent for Dr. Seely to perform the procedure actually\n\nperformed. But no Washington case law or statutory authority provides that a\n\nphysician who did not perform or otherwise control a procedure is liable for a lack\n\nof informed consent for a procedure performed by another physician. And the\n\ntrial court specifically denied summary judgment on the informed consent claim\n\nagainst Dr. Seely.\n\n       Additionally, in addressing the RCW 7.70.050 factors required to prove a\n\nlack of informed consent, Belisle fails to reference Dr. Zundel at all. Belisle\n\nstates that she consented to the procedure without being fully aware of or\n\ninformed of the difference between having a scope through one\u2019s larynx and\n\nesophagus and having a piece of tissue removed, especially by a physician she\n\nalready suspected of \u201cbotching\u201d the initial procedure. She then maintains that\n\nany reasonable person would not have consented given the full information and\n\n\n                                         13\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/14\n\n\nthat Dr. Seely further injured her throat in the process. She makes no assertions\n\nas to Dr. Zundel\u2019s role in the process.\n\n       Because Belisle conflates the dismissed informed consent claim against\n\nDr. Zundel with the maintained claim against Dr. Seely, Dr. Zundel is not liable\n\nfor damages for failure to obtain informed consent on a procedure performed by\n\nDr. Seely, and Belisle fails to establish that Dr. Zundel failed to obtain informed\n\nconsent, summary judgment was proper.\n\n       2. Medical Bills\n\n       Belisle next claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment\n\nconcerning her medical bills was prejudicial error. Because the trial court\n\nproperly denied Belisle\u2019s motion to shorten time and did not rule on her motion\n\nfor summary judgment, Belisle is incorrect.\n\n       \u201cA trial court has discretion when ruling on a motion to shorten time.\u201d\n\nState ex rel. Citizens Against Tolls (CAT) v. Murphy, 151 Wn.2d 226, 236, 88\n\nP.3d 375 (2004). A trial court also has discretion to \u201cachieve the orderly and\n\nexpeditious disposition of cases.\u201d Peluso v. Barton Auto Dealerships, Inc., 138\n\nWn. App. 65, 71, 155 P.3d 978 (2007). Under Civil Rule (CR) 56(c), a motion for\n\nsummary judgment \u201cshall be filed and served not later than 28 calendar days\n\nbefore the hearing.\u201d\n\n       Here, the court initially set trial for October 30, 2023. The scheduling\n\norder required all dispositive motions decided by October 16, 2023, two weeks\n\nbefore trial. Belisle filed her motion for summary judgment on September 28,\n\n2023. Because a motion for summary judgment shall be filed no later than 28\n\n\n                                          14\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/15\n\n\ndays before the hearing, the hearing on Belisle\u2019s motion for summary judgment\n\nwould have taken place on October 27, 2023. Recognizing that this placed her\n\noutside the deadline for dispositive motions, Belisle moved to shorten time. She\n\nfailed to provide any legal authority and her only argument was that \u201cthere really\n\nis no genuine issue as to whether these medical records and bills show\n\nreasonable and necessary treatments and billings.\u201d She did not offer any\n\nexplanation as to why she filed the motion for summary judgment late.\n\n       On appeal, Belisle asserts that the trial court erred in denying the motion\n\nto shorten time based on rigid application of technical legal rules rather than the\n\nmerits of the motion. She then contends that the denial of the motion for\n\nsummary judgment prejudiced Belisle because it forced plaintiff\u2019s counsel to\n\nwade through each medical bill individually at trial.\n\n       To the former, Belisle did not provide any explanation as to why her\n\nmotion was filed so late nor any authority as to why she was entitled to a\n\ndispositive ruling on the issue. Her only argument was that \u201c[n]o one here in\n\nanyway [sic] disputes that the medical treatment and billing is reasonable.\u201d But\n\nas Proliance and Dr. Seely articulated, they did clearly contest medical causation\n\nand that causation is central to the reasonableness of medical care and\n\nnecessity of any resulting medical bills. Given the clear deadlines, the lack of\n\nlegal authority, and the lack of explanation as to why the motion was filed beyond\n\nthe deadline in the case scheduling order, we conclude that the trial court did not\n\nmanifestly abuse its discretion in denying Belisle\u2019s motion to shorten time.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/16\n\n\n       To the latter, we conclude that Belisle misrepresents the trial court\u2019s order\n\nand fails to establish resulting prejudice because the trial court specifically stated,\n\noutside the presence of the jury, that any delay resulted from the plaintiff\u2019s poor\n\ntime management.\n\n       Again, Belisle asserts that the trial court erred in denying her motion for\n\nsummary judgment. But the trial court did not rule on her motion for summary\n\njudgment. And Belisle fails to establish that any of the supposed prejudice\n\nactually resulted from the denial of the motion to shorten time.\n\n       The record confirms that plaintiff\u2019s counsel repeatedly arrived to court late,\n\nasked repetitive questions that unnecessarily extended testimony, and failed to\n\nadequately allocate time for more relevant evidence. In fact, when plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncounsel approached double the amount of time he had estimated for more than\n\none witness, the court stated:\n              I have seen \u2014 so far all the extra time \u2014 you keep pointing\n       to the medical bills as reason you need more time. But everything\n       I\u2019ve observed are delays coming from other reasons. . . .\n             I\u2019m just warning you, you need to be efficient with presenting\n       your case. And, frankly, what I\u2019m observing is not efficient.\n\nBelisle suggests that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant her summary judgment\n\nmotion forced her to march through the bills one by one, causing the inefficiency.\n\nThis inefficiency then frustrated the court, leading to admonishment Belisle\n\ncontends constituted an expression of bias in front of the jury. But as noted, the\n\nrecord shows that while the delays may have centered on the medical bills, they\n\nresulted from plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s actions. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel could have moved\n\nthrough the individual exhibits in a smoother and more efficient manner.\n\n\n                                          16\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/17\n\n\n       Additionally, any admonishment from the court often took place outside of\n\nthe presence of the jury. As a result, the jury would not have been impacted by\n\nany alleged expression of bias.\n\n       Because the court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in denying\n\nBelisle\u2019s motion to shorten time and the denial did not prejudice her case, the trial\n\ncourt did not err.\n\n                                 Evidentiary Rulings\n\n       Belisle contends that the trial court erred in limiting Belisle\u2019s medical\n\ntestimony, allowing Proliance\u2019s late-disclosed expert to testify, and precluding\n\nargument about Dr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis. Proliance disagrees,\n\nnoting that the record does not display any such limitation, Proliance\u2019s expert did\n\nnot testify at trial, and Belisle failed to establish the diagnosis\u2019s relevance. We\n\nagree with Proliance.\n\n       We review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. Bengtsson v.\n\nSunnyworld Int\u2019l, Inc., 14 Wn. App. 2d 91, 99, 469 P.3d 339 (2020). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion if its ruling is manifestly unreasonable or based on\n\nuntenable grounds or reasons. Bengtsson, 14 Wn. App. 2d at 99. But an\n\nevidentiary error is only grounds for reversal if it results in prejudice. Bengtsson,\n\n14 Wn. App. 2d at 99. \u201c \u2018An error is prejudicial if \u2018within reasonable probabilities,\n\nhad the error not occurred, the outcome of the trial would have been materially\n\naffected.\u2019 \u201d Bengtsson, 14 Wn. App. 2d at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n(quoting City of Seattle v. Pearson, 192 Wn. App. 802, 817, 369 P.3d 194\n\n(2016)).\n\n\n                                          17\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/18\n\n\n       1. Medical Testimony\n\n       Belisle states that the trial court erred by granting a motion in limine that\n\n\u201ceffectively muzzled\u201d her; limiting her ability to testify to her own medical\n\nconditions and diagnoses in the language she would normally use as a trained\n\nand experienced nurse. Because the record does not display any such limitation\n\nand Belisle fails to provide legal authority to support her argument, the court did\n\nnot err.\n\n       Generally, an appellate brief must include \u201cargument in support of the\n\nissues presented for review, together with citations to legal authority and\n\nreferences to relevant parts of the record.\u201d RAP 10.3(a)(6).\n\n       Belisle claims that the trial court granted Proliance\u2019s motion in limine,\n\nimproperly precluding Belisle from testifying about medical issues in the\n\nlanguage she would normally use as a trained emergency nurse. But the portion\n\nof the record that Belisle cites in support of her claim addresses a Proliance\n\nmotion attempting to preclude expert witnesses from testifying specifically to\n\ncausation. Belisle is not an expert witness and the trial court denied Proliance\u2019s\n\nmotion.\n\n       Proliance did move to preclude Belisle from testifying about her mental\n\nand emotional pain and suffering later in the record but the trial court again\n\ndenied that motion. And the trial court reserved ruling on a motion to exclude\n\nnon-physician testimony on medical facts, standards of care, and causation,\n\nspecifically noting, \u201cpresumably some people can testify to what we might call\n\nmedical facts, for example, . . . [Belisle is] not a physician \u2014 well, she is a nurse.\u201d\n\n\n                                          18\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/19\n\n\nThe record does not support Belisle\u2019s assertion that the trial court granted any\n\nparticular motion in limine.\n\n       In addition to misrepresenting the record, Belisle presents no legal\n\nauthority to support her argument that the trial court acted improperly. Instead,\n\nBelisle makes the broad statement that \u201cit simply cannot be an accurate\n\nstatement of the law that a plaintiff with twenty years\u2019 experience as an ER nurse\n\ncannot bring that experience to bear on her own understanding of the diagnoses\n\nand treatments she received.\u201d She provides no case law or statutory authority to\n\nexplain why that simply cannot be the case. She then continues on to request\n\nthat this court draw \u201ca clearer line than currently exists in Washington law.\u201d\n\n       Because Belisle provides no citations to legal authority nor references to\n\nrelevant parts of the record, we conclude the trial court did not improperly limit\n\nBelisle\u2019s testimony.\n\n       2. Expert Testimony\n\n       Belisle next asserts that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Michael\n\nRubenstein, a late-disclosed Proliance expert witness to testify. Because the trial\n\ncourt acted appropriately in refusing to exclude Dr. Rubenstein under Burnet v.\n\nSpokane Ambulance, 131 Wn.2d 484, 933 P.2d 1036 (1997), and Dr. Rubenstein\n\ndid not actually testify at trial, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion and no prejudice occurred.\n\n       Before determining that exclusion of a witness is an appropriate sanction\n\nfor late-disclosure, a trial court must explicitly consider whether the late-\n\ndisclosure was willful or deliberate, whether it substantially prejudiced the\n\n\n                                           19\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/20\n\n\nopposing party\u2019s attempts to prepare for trial, and whether lesser sanctions would\n\nsuffice. Burnet, 131 Wn.2d at 1040-41.\n\n       We review a trial court\u2019s application of the Burnet factors for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Scott v. Grader, 105 Wn. App. 136, 152, 18 P.3d 1150 (2001). But\n\nan error, including an abuse of discretion, is harmless if it is \u201c \u2018trivial, or formal, or\n\nmerely academic, and was not prejudicial to the substantial rights of the party\n\nassigning it, and in no way affected the final outcome of the case.\u2019 \u201d Veit v.\n\nBurlington N. Santa Fe Corp, 171 Wn.2d 88, 99, 249 P.3d 607 (2011) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Mackay v. Acorn Custom Cabinetry, Inc., 127\n\nWn.2d 302, 311, 898 P.2d 284 (1995)).\n\n       Here, Proliance disclosed Dr. Rubenstein as a new expert after the April\n\n2023 discovery cutoff but six weeks before trial. Proliance asserted that good\n\ncause existed to allow Dr. Rubenstein to testify because he would rebut new\n\ndeclarations Belisle submitted in response to an August 2023 summary judgment\n\nmotion. Proliance further contended that the late disclosure was neither willful\n\nnor prejudicial given Belisle\u2019s new declarations.\n\n       In response to Proliance\u2019s motion, Belisle did not discuss any of the\n\nBurnet factors. Rather, Belisle stated only, \u201c[m]y neurosurgeon says that if this is\n\nallowed that I must also get a neurologist to support him and not be 2 of the\n\ndefendants\u2019 experts versus just him.\u201d\n\n       The trial court then marched through the Burnet factors, noting that Belisle\n\ndid not dispute Proliance\u2019s assertion that the proposed witness served to respond\n\nto new opinions set forth in her own expert declarations, that Belisle failed to\n\n\n                                            20\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/21\n\n\narticulate why she would need a new expert if Dr. Rubenstein was not excluded,\n\nand that any prejudice could be easily mitigated. Although the trial court did not\n\nexplicitly address whether lesser sanctions would suffice, Belisle presented no\n\nargument as to why only exclusion was appropriate and the court clearly\n\narticulated that each Burnet factor failed to justify excluding Dr. Rubenstein as a\n\nwitness.\n\n       Additionally, Proliance did not call Dr. Rubenstein to testify at trial. As a\n\nresult, the trial court\u2019s refusal to exclude Dr. Rubenstein as a potential witness in\n\nno way affected the final outcome of the case. Therefore, any error would be\n\nharmless.\n\n       We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\n\nexclude Dr. Rubenstein from the witness list and no resulting prejudice occurred.\n\n       3. Parkinson\u2019s Diagnosis\n\n       Belisle then contends that the trial court erred in excluding argument about\n\nDr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis because the diagnosis could have\n\nbeen the causal link to establish Dr. Seely\u2019s negligence. Because Belisle failed\n\nto present any evidence to support this claim, the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in excluding argument linking the diagnosis to negligence on Dr.\n\nSeely\u2019s part.\n\n       Evidence must be relevant to be admissible. ER 402. Evidence is\n\nrelevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact of consequence\n\nmore or less probable. ER 401.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/22\n\n\n       Belisle asserts that Dr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease likely impacted his\n\nability to perform surgery at the time of her operation and that his later diagnosis\n\nis clearly relevant evidence. She fails, however, to provide any evidence at all\n\nthat Dr. Seely was impacted by the disease at the time of her surgery. Before\n\nthe trial court, Belisle stated only, \u201cWikipedia, everybody is saying [Parkinson\u2019s\n\ndisplays early signs].\u201d She did not provide any expert testimony, nor did she\n\nexplain who \u201ceverybody\u201d is. And when asked specifically by the court for any\n\nadmissible evidence that Dr. Seely may have suffered Parkinson\u2019s symptoms at\n\nthe time of surgery, Belisle conceded, \u201cno, I don\u2019t have any evidence, Your\n\nHonor.\u201d\n\n       Belisle next suggests that this lack of evidence is immaterial because\n\nProliance sprung the diagnosis on opposing counsel at trial and Belisle did not\n\nhave time to find an expert witness. But, in April 2023, Belisle deposed Dr. Seely\n\nfor three hours and had ample opportunity to discover Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis. In\n\nfact, Dr. Seely disclosed in that deposition that he left the practice on medical\n\nleave in May 2018. Belisle did not ask any further questions about that medical\n\nleave. Neither Dr. Seely nor defense counsel hid the diagnosis from Belisle at\n\nany point. 2\n\n       2  At oral argument, Belisle\u2019s attorney contended that the exclusion of\nDr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis implicated a discovery issue because\nProliance denied Belisle\u2019s attempts to uncover Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis. The record\ndoes not reflect any such denial. No indication exists that Dr. Seely failed to\nrespond to any discovery requests concerning his health. To the contrary,\nBelisle\u2019s trial attorney noted that they were unaware of any diagnosis until\nProliance raised the issue as a motion in limine. And even had Belisle been able\nto prove discovery interference, she admitted to a complete lack of evidence\nconnecting Dr. Seely\u2019s diagnosis with the alleged injury. Furthermore, Belisle did\n\n                                         22\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/23\n\n\n       Here, Belisle failed to provide any admissible evidence indicating that\n\nDr. Seely\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease impacted her surgery. As a result, the trial court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in precluding argument based on the diagnosis.\n\n                               Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n       Belisle claims that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the\n\njury\u2019s determination that Dr. Seely was not negligent. Proliance first contends\n\nthat Belisle failed to preserve the issue for appeal. Proliance then asserts that\n\nsubstantial evidence supported the verdict and Belisle improperly asks this court\n\nto reweigh evidence.\n\n       Generally, a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal.\n\nRAP 2.5(a). A party may only raise an issue for the first time if it addresses lack\n\nof jurisdiction, failure to establish facts upon which relief can be granted, or\n\nmanifest constitutional error. RAP 2.5(a). When a party does not present a claim\n\nof insufficiency of the evidence to the trial court, it is not subject to review on\n\nappeal. Fowlkes v. International Broth. of Elec. Workers, Local No. 76, 58 Wn.\n\nApp. 759, 772-73, 759 P.2d 137 (1990).\n\n       Belisle did not raise the issue of insufficient evidence before the jury\n\nverdict nor did she move for a new trial or reconsideration after the verdict. We\n\nconclude that Belisle failed to raise the issue below and none of the RAP 2.5(a)\n\nexclusions apply.\n\n\n\n\nnot move for a continuance to conduct additional discovery or obtain more\nevidence.\n\n\n\n                                           23\n\fNo. 86242-1-I/24\n\n\n                      University of Washington Involvement\n\n       Lastly, Belisle assigns error on the basis that newly discovered evidence\n\nwould have been material to the outcome of the trial. Because Belisle did not\n\nraise this issue below, we decline to reach it.\n\n       Again, a party generally may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal.\n\nRAP 2.5(a). If newly discovered evidence arises after the close of trial,\n\nCR 59(a)(4) allows a party to move for a new trial provided that evidence would\n\nnot have been discovered and produced at trial. CR 60(b)(3) then allows relief\n\nfrom judgment if newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered in\n\ntime to move for a new trial.\n\n       On appeal, a party must include legal authority and references to the\n\nrecord in support of the issues presented for review. RAP 10.3(a)(6).\n\n       Here, Belisle asserts that newly discovered evidence that the University of\n\nWashington manipulates patient care to protect physicians from malpractice suits\n\nwould have impacted the jury\u2019s verdict. She failed to raise this issue during trial,\n\nor to move for a new trial or relief from judgment as a result of that newly\n\ndiscovered evidence. We conclude that Belisle failed to raise the issue below\n\nand decline to reach the issue.\n\n       We affirm.\n\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                                         24"

During this time, he was\n\nconfined to a wheelchair. He alleges that after falling from his wheelchair\n\nand suffering serious injury, jail officials refused to assist him despite his\n\nrepeated requests for medical attention.\n\n      Two of these jail officials, Deputy Dennis Rabie and Detention\n\nSpecialist Daniel DeHerrera, moved to dismiss Hardy\u2019s claims against them\n\non the grounds that they had qualified immunity. The district court held\n\nthat Hardy plausibly alleged that Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera violated his clearly established Fourteenth Amendment rights,\n\nand thus that they are not entitled to qualified immunity. Exercising\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 3\n\n\n\n                                        I\n\n                                        A\n\n      The facts of this case are presented as alleged by Hardy in the light\n\nmost favorable to him, giving him the benefit of every reasonable inference\n\ntherefrom. See Gaines v. Stenseng, 292 F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir. 2002). In\n\nSeptember 2022, Hardy was an inmate at ACDF on pretrial detention.\n\nDuring this time, he was confined to the use of a wheelchair.1\n\n      On September 22, Hardy fell out of his wheelchair in his cell. He was\n\nattempting to get around a barrier to the toilet in his cell and fell as he tried\n\nto transfer himself. Hardy was then unable to pick himself back up from the\n\nfloor because of an \u201cinjury in his lower back, which is permanent in nature.\u201d\n\nAplt. App. I at 24. Hardy\u2019s cellmate pressed an \u201cemergency distress button\u201d\n\nin the cell designed to call for help. Id. Hardy alleges that his cellmate\n\npressed the button three times over a period of 30 to 45 minutes, but no\n\nhelp arrived.\n\n      Detention Specialist DeHerrera was on duty at the time in a control\n\ntower and received signals from the emergency distress button. Instead of\n\nnotifying deputies of an emergency or responding himself, Detention\n\n\n\n\n      1 Hardy alleges that he was forced to use a wheelchair because of\ninjuries sustained after two unknown sheriff\u2019s deputies attacked him. This\nclaim has not been raised on appeal.\n                                       3\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 4\n\n\n\nSpecialist DeHerrera allegedly ignored the emergency distress signals\n\ncoming from Hardy\u2019s cell. Hardy was later told by another jail official,\n\nDeputy Chavez (not named as a defendant), that Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera\u2019s unit does not respond to emergency distress calls because\n\n\u201csome inmates abuse the buttons, and they are not going to spend their\n\nentire shift chasing buttons.\u201d Id. at 26.\n\n      Hardy alleges that he \u201cremained [on] the floor of his cell for nearly an\n\nhour, or more in severe pain, and suffering, and had degradingly soiled\n\nhimself because of the pain and inability to move.\u201d Id. at 24. After it became\n\nclear that jail officials were not coming, Hardy\u2019s cellmate helped him back\n\ninto his wheelchair. However, Hardy states that this \u201c[put] him in more\n\npain\u201d and that he was placed back in a \u201ccontorted seated position in the\n\nwheelchair.\u201d Id. at 24\u201325. As such, the efforts of Hardy\u2019s cellmate caused\n\nhim to be \u201cfurther injured[.]\u201d Id.\n\n      Roughly ninety minutes after he fell, Deputy Rabie came to Hardy\u2019s\n\ncell as an escort for the inmate porters who were bringing him dinner.\n\nDeputy Rabie opened the cell door and \u201cfound [Hardy] in the same contorted\n\nposition and in extreme pain.\u201d Id. at 25. Deputy Rabie asked what had\n\nhappened to him, and Hardy explained that he had fallen and \u201cverbally\n\ndeclared a medical emergency.\u201d Id. Deputy Rabie did not take Hardy to\n\n\n\n                                       4\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 5\n\n\n\nreceive medical care, and instead told him to \u201cfile a grievance\u201d before closing\n\nhis cell. Id.\n\n      After an unspecified amount of time, there was a \u201cshift change\u201d and\n\nDeputy Chavez came by Hardy\u2019s cell with a nurse to pass out evening\n\nmedication. Deputy Chavez and the nurse then rendered medical attention.\n\n                                       B\n\n      Hardy filed this action pro se under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against multiple\n\ndefendants including Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist DeHerrera in\n\ntheir individual and official capacities.2 In this appeal, we are only asked to\n\nconsider Hardy\u2019s deliberate indifference claims with respect to Deputy\n\nRabie and Detention Specialist DeHerrera.\n\n      Hardy     claimed   that   Deputy    Rabie   and   Detention     Specialist\n\nDeHerrera were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s right to due process. Deputy Rabie and Detention\n\nSpecialist DeHerrera filed motions to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil\n\n\n      2 In his amended and operative complaint, Hardy made four different\n\nclaims in total against various defendants: (1) failure to protect and\nexcessive force against Adams County, the current and former sheriffs, and\ntwo unknown deputies; (2) deliberate indifference and cruel and unusual\npunishment against Adams County, the sheriffs, Deputy Rabie, Detention\nSpecialist DeHerrera, and Deputy Jennifer Overmyer; (3) discrimination in\nviolation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against\nAdams County, the sheriffs, and Deputy Overmyer; and (4) retaliation in\nviolation of the First Amendment against Adams County and the sheriffs.\n\n                                       5\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 6\n\n\n\nProcedure 12(b)(6), arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nThe magistrate judge recommended denying their motion to dismiss,\n\nfinding that Hardy\u2019s complaint sufficiently alleged that both defendants\n\nacted with deliberate indifference. Over defendants\u2019 objections, the district\n\ncourt adopted the recommendations of the magistrate judge with respect to\n\nthe motion to dismiss claims against Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera. Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist DeHerrera then filed\n\nthis timely appeal.\n\n                                       II\n\n      We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\n\nto dismiss based on qualified immunity. See Wilson v. Montano, 715 F.3d\n\n847, 852 (10th Cir. 2013). \u201cDismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot\n\nprevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an\n\nopportunity to amend.\u201d Gaines, 292 F.3d at 1224 (quoting Curley v. Perry,\n\n246 F.3d 1278, 1281 (10th Cir. 2001)). \u201cIn determining whether a dismissal\n\nis proper, we must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and\n\nconstrue those allegations, and any reasonable inferences that might be\n\ndrawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d Gaines, 292\n\nF.3d at 1224. To state a claim, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c[f]actual allegations must be\n\nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level[.]\u201d Bell Atl. Corp.\n\n                                       6\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 7\n\n\n\nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements\n\nof a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not\n\nsuffice.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).\n\n      \u201cIn addition, we must construe a pro se appellant\u2019s complaint\n\nliberally.\u201d Gaines, 292 F.3d at 1224. Nonetheless, this court has \u201crepeatedly\n\ninsisted that pro se parties follow the same rules of procedure that govern\n\nother litigants.\u201d Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836,\n\n840 (10th Cir. 2005) (quoting Nielsen v. Price, 17 F.3d 1276, 1277 (10th Cir.\n\n1994)).\n\n                                      III\n\n      \u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials . . .\n\nfrom liability for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\n\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\n\nwould have known.\u201d Buck v. City of Albuquerque, 549 F.3d 1269, 1277 (10th\n\nCir. 2008) (quoting Boles v. Neet, 486 F.3d 1177, 1180 (10th Cir. 2007)). \u201cA\n\n\u00a7 1983 defendant\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity is an \u2018affirmative\n\ndefense [that] creates a presumption that the defendant is immune from\n\nsuit.\u2019\u201d Truman v. Orem City, 1 F.4th 1227, 1235 (10th Cir. 2021) (alteration\n\nin original) (quoting Est. of Smart by Smart v. City of Wichita, 951 F.3d\n\n1161, 1168 (10th Cir. 2020)). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss based on\n\nqualified immunity,\u201d the burden is on the plaintiff to \u201callege sufficient facts\n\n                                       7\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1    Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 8\n\n\n\nthat show\u2014when taken as true\u2014the defendant plausibly violated his\n\nconstitutional rights, which were clearly established at the time of\n\nviolation.\u201d Schwartz v. Booker, 702 F.3d 573, 579 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\n     Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist DeHerrera argue both that\n\n(1) Hardy has failed to allege facts showing that they violated his\n\nconstitutional rights, and (2) even if his rights were violated, those rights\n\nwere not clearly established. We consider each of these issues in turn.\n\n                                       A\n\n     We first ask whether Hardy\u2019s constitutional rights were violated. Jail\n\nofficials violate a detainee\u2019s constitutional rights through deliberate\n\nindifference whenever they knowingly ignore a \u201csubstantial risk of serious\n\nharm\u201d to an inmate. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828\u201329 (1994).\n\n\u201cDeliberate   indifference   has   objective   and    subjective   components.\u201d\n\nCallahan v. Poppell, 471 F.3d 1155, 1159 (10th Cir. 2006). To meet the\n\nobjective component, the harm suffered must be \u201csufficiently serious\u201d to\n\nimplicate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.3 Id. Under the subjective component, \u201cthe [inmate] must show\n\n\n     3  As a pretrial detainee, Hardy is not protected by the Eighth\nAmendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, but he\nnonetheless has the same rights through the Fourteenth Amendment Due\nProcess Clause. See Garcia v. Salt Lake Cnty., 768 F.2d 303, 307 (10th Cir.\n1985).\n\n                                       8\n\f   Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 9\n\n\n\nthat the defendants knew he faced a substantial risk of harm and\n\ndisregarded that risk, by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                       1\n\n     \u201cA medical need is considered sufficiently serious to satisfy the\n\nobjective prong if the condition \u2018has been diagnosed by a physician as\n\nmandating treatment or is so obvious that even a lay person would easily\n\nrecognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u2019\u201d Al-Turki v. Robinson, 762\n\nF.3d 1188, 1192\u201393 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting Oxendine v. Kaplan, 241 F.3d\n\n1272, 1276 (10th Cir. 2001)). Where, as here, an inmate is alleging that they\n\nwere harmed by a delay in eventual medical treatment, the objective\n\ncomponent of harm \u201cmay be satisfied by lifelong handicap, permanent loss,\n\nor considerable pain.\u201d Id. at 1193 (quoting Garrett v. Stratman, 254 F.3d\n\n946, 950 (10th Cir. 2001)). Thus, this standard can be satisfied merely by\n\n\u201can intermediate injury, such as the pain experienced while waiting for\n\ntreatment and analgesics.\u201d Id. (citation omitted).\n\n     Hardy did not describe any specific injuries sustained from his fall,\n\nnor does he name any subsequent treatment by a doctor. His complaint is\n\nsparse and fails to describe any long-term consequences resulting from the\n\nfall. The only indications of harm are his descriptions of dealing with\n\n\u201csevere pain\u201d and discomfort and his generic statements that he was\n\n                                       9\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 10\n\n\n\n\u201cfurther injured\u201d and sustained an \u201cinjury in his lower back, which is\n\npermanent in nature.\u201d Aplt. App. I at 24\u201325. Still, Hardy plausibly alleges\n\nthat he suffered extreme, though temporary, pain because of his fall.\n\n      Defendants concede that, accepting all of Hardy\u2019s allegations as true,\n\nDetention Specialist DeHerrera\u2019s actions caused Hardy sufficiently serious\n\nharm to meet the objective prong because he spent ninety minutes in pain\n\nbefore Deputy Rabie arrived. However, they argue that Deputy Rabie\u2019s\n\nactions cannot be tied to \u201cany meaningful delay in receiving medical\n\ntreatment\u201d and thus he did not objectively violate Hardy\u2019s constitutional\n\nrights. Reply Br. at 13\u201314. \u201cCertainly, not every twinge of pain suffered as\n\nthe result of delay in medical care is actionable.\u201d Sealock v. Colorado, 218\n\nF.3d 1205, 1210 (10th Cir. 2000). We must determine whether Hardy has\n\npleaded sufficiently serious pain to present an objective harm related to\n\nDeputy Rabie\u2019s actions.\n\n      Our case law on this subject generally concerns painful events that\n\nlast for hours or days. See McCowan v. Morales, 945 F.3d 1276, 1291 (10th\n\nCir. 2019) (\u201c[The plaintiff] does assert that [the defendant\u2019s] delay in getting\n\n[the plaintiff] to the detention center resulted in [the plaintiff] suffering up\n\nto several hours of excruciating pain.\u201d); Al-Turki, 762 F.3d at 1193 (\u201cThis\n\nsevere pain and fear of death lasted for several hours, during which Plaintiff\n\nwas provided with neither the medical treatment that could have reduced\n\n                                      10\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 11\n\n\n\nhis pain nor the medical diagnosis that could have removed his fear of\n\ndeath.\u201d); Sealock, 218 F.3d at 1210 (\u201cThe pain and suffering imposed by [the\n\ndefendant\u2019s] failure to get him treatment lasted several hours.\u201d); Mata v.\n\nSaiz, 427 F.3d 745, 754 (10th Cir. 2005) (\u201cIn the present case, [the plaintiff]\n\npresented evidence that she did in fact suffer severe pain for several days.\u201d).\n\n      Hardy\u2019s complaint alleges that when Deputy Rabie opened his cell\n\ndoor, he found Hardy \u201cin extreme pain.\u201d Aplt App. I at 25. The complaint\n\ndoes not describe what happened between Deputy Rabie closing his cell door\n\nand him getting assistance from Deputy Chavez \u201c[a]fter the shift change[.]\u201d\n\nId. at 26. However, he does state that Deputy Rabie \u201cleft [Hardy] in pain\n\nand suffering\u201d implying that his pain was ongoing during this unspecified\n\namount of time. Id. Even in the absence of a specific timeline, it is\n\nreasonable to infer from the alleged facts that some meaningful amount of\n\ntime passed between shift changes. And under our standard of review, we\n\nmust construe \u201cany reasonable inferences\u201d that might be drawn from\n\nHardy\u2019s allegations \u201cin the light most favorable to\u201d him. Gaines, 292 F.3d\n\nat 1224.\n\n      There is no precise amount of suffering that makes a delay in medical\n\ncare actionable. Whether pain and suffering are sufficiently serious for a\n\ndeliberate indifference claim depends on context, and \u201c[e]ven a brief delay\n\n[in medical treatment] may be unconstitutional.\u201d Mata, 427 F.3d at 755. We\n\n                                      11\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 12\n\n\n\nread Hardy\u2019s complaint to demonstrate much more than a mere \u201ctwinge of\n\npain\u201d from Deputy Rabie\u2019s actions, Sealock, 218 F.3d at 1210, and so he has\n\nsufficiently pleaded objective harm. See Mata, 427 F.3d at 753 (\u201c[T]he\n\npurpose [of the objectivity component] is to limit claims to significant, as\n\nopposed to trivial, suffering[.]\u201d).\n\n      Further, our case law has described objective harm in multiple ways.\n\nObjective harm has been characterized as either \u201c(1) the alleged harm to\n\nthe prisoner or (2) the prisoner\u2019s symptoms at the time of the prison\n\nemployee\u2019s actions.\u201d Id. The latter is not about the ultimate harm or risk of\n\nharm, but how that harm would appear to an objective observer. See Prince\n\nv. Sheriff of Carter Cnty., 28 F.4th 1033, 1045 (10th Cir. 2022) (\u201cYet because\n\nwe conclude that [the plaintiff\u2019s] earlier symptoms should prompt a\n\nlayperson to seek immediate medical attention, the risk of death was an\n\nincorrect inquiry.\u201d).\n\n      Regardless of the actual amount of time in pain caused by the delay,\n\nHardy alleged that he displayed signs of extreme pain and suffering that\n\nwould be obvious to a layperson in Deputy Rabie\u2019s position. Jail officials are\n\nnot given a free pass to deliberately ignore an inmate\u2019s serious medical\n\nneeds simply because a shift change was forthcoming that allowed another\n\njail official to come by and render medical attention later. See Al-Turki, 762\n\nF.3d at 1194 (\u201cThe main flaw in Defendant\u2019s argument is that she is\n\n                                      12\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 13\n\n\n\nfocusing on the facts we now know about the duration and cause of\n\nPlaintiff\u2019s pain, while the pertinent question for determining her\n\nentitlement to qualified immunity depends on the facts that were known at\n\nthe time.\u201d). As such, Hardy has made a sufficient showing of objective harm.\n\n                                       2\n\n      Because the objective prong has been met for both defendants, we now\n\nconsider whether Detention Specialist DeHerrera was subjectively aware of\n\na serious risk of harm to Hardy. The subjective component requires a\n\ndefendant to \u201cboth be aware of facts from which the inference could be\n\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw\n\nthe inference.\u201d Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. Defendants argue that Detention\n\nSpecialist DeHerrera could not have subjectively known that Hardy was at\n\nany risk of harm.\n\n      Hardy only alleged that Detention Specialist DeHerrera was in a\n\ncontrol tower where he would have seen that the emergency call button was\n\npressed three times in Hardy\u2019s cell. Although many details are missing, this\n\nallegation is still sufficient to show subjective awareness of a serious risk of\n\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 14\n\n\n\nharm.4 Deliberate indifference does not always require a direct refusal to\n\ngive an inmate medical attention. A jail official exhibits deliberate\n\nindifference if he \u201cknows that his role in a particular medical emergency is\n\nsolely to serve as a gatekeeper for other medical personnel capable of\n\ntreating the condition, and if he delays or refuses to fulfill that gatekeeper\n\nrole due to deliberate indifference[.]\u201d Sealock, 218 F.3d at 1211. According\n\nto Hardy, Deputy Chavez told him that Detention Specialist DeHerrera\n\nchose not to respond to signals from emergency buttons.5 As such, he has\n\n\n\n      4 There is an inherent information asymmetry in cases such as this\n\nwhere an inmate cannot know what is happening outside of their cell. We\nmaintain our pleading standards even in such cases on the understanding\nthat \u201c[n]ot only do prisoners ordinarily know what has happened to them;\nbut they will have learned how the institution has defended the challenged\nconduct when they pursue the administrative claims that they must bring\nas a prerequisite to filing suit.\u201d Gee v. Pacheco, 627 F.3d 1178, 1185 (10th\nCir. 2010). Hardy has pursued administrative remedies and describes\nspeaking to Deputy Chavez about the incident in his pleading. As such, his\nplacement of Detention Specialist DeHerrera as the one monitoring the\nemergency call buttons appears to be more than mere speculation.\n      5 Defendants argue that \u201c[a]s a    non-deputy stationed in the tower,\n[Detention Specialist DeHerrera] would never be called upon to leave the\ntower to \u2018chase[e] buttons.\u2019\u201d Op. Br. at 35\u201336. But they do not offer any\nsupport for this statement, and we lack a Martinez report that might allow\nus to better understand ACDF operations. See Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d\n1106, 1112 (10th Cir. 1991) (A Martinez report \u201caids the court in its broad\nreading of the pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings . . . by supplementing a plaintiff\u2019s\noften inadequate description of the practices that he contends are\nunconstitutional.\u201d). Hardy\u2019s complaint states that he learned from Deputy\nChavez that Detention Specialist DeHerrera did not respond to buttons, and\nso the allegation is not conclusory.\n\n                                      14\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 15\n\n\n\nalleged facts showing that Detention Specialist DeHerrera served as a\n\ngatekeeper to medical care by monitoring the emergency call buttons, and\n\nthat he chose not to fulfill that duty.6\n\n      Seeing an emergency button go off from a cell multiple times\n\nreasonably indicates that some kind of emergency requiring a response is\n\nhappening in that cell. See Velez v. Johnson, 395 F.3d 732, 736 (7th Cir.\n\n2005) (\u201cFor one thing, [the inmate] pushed an \u2018emergency call button,\u2019 a\n\nclear indication that an emergency was at hand.\u201d). That is not to say that\n\nignoring an emergency button always constitutes subjective awareness of a\n\nserious risk of harm. If, for instance, Hardy or his cellmate had a known\n\nhistory of abusing his emergency call button and pressing it at random,\n\nDetention Specialist DeHerrera might have inferred that a button being\n\n\n\n\n      6 Defendants urge us to extend Lance v. Morris, where we found that\n\none defendant in a control tower who spoke with an inmate about a medical\nissue did not display deliberate indifference when he refused to get him\nmedical attention. 985 F.3d 787, 794\u201396 (10th Cir. 2021). But in that case,\nunlike here, the defendant was able to speak with the prisoner, and the\nprisoner did not initially request medical attention or describe any pain. Id.\nat 795. (\u201cAccording to [the plaintiff], he had only one conversation with [the\ndefendant]. In that conversation, [the plaintiff] did not provide enough\ninformation to suggest a serious medical need[.]\u201d). But later on, the plaintiff\nspoke to a different defendant in the control tower and requested medical\nattention. Id. at 797. This court found that the second defendant in Lance\nwas subjectively made aware of a substantial risk of serious harm. Id. Here,\nDetention Specialist DeHerrera only knew that Hardy\u2019s cell was signaling\nfor some kind of emergency distress, and he had no reason to presume there\nwas not an actual emergency.\n                                      15\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 16\n\n\n\npressed in that cell did not indicate an actual medical emergency. But\n\nnothing in Hardy\u2019s complaint would lead us to believe that type of history\n\nwas present here. We can also reasonably infer that Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera would have seen that the button was pressed if he was in fact in\n\nthe control tower. And Hardy has alleged that Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera ignored the signal both because help never arrived and because\n\nDeputy Chavez told him so. As such, Hardy has sufficiently pleaded that\n\nDetention Specialist DeHerrera was subjectively aware of a serious risk of\n\nharm and nonetheless refused to fulfill his role as a gatekeeper to medical\n\ncare.\n\n                                       3\n\n        As for Deputy Rabie, Defendants argue that it would not have been\n\nclear to him that Hardy needed medical attention. Deputy Rabie did not\n\nknow that the emergency button had been pressed and only came by Hardy\u2019s\n\ncell to bring him dinner. Defendants argue that by this time, Hardy was\n\nsitting down in his wheelchair again and had been cleaned up by his\n\ncellmate, and thus it would not be clear that he had fallen. Hardy\u2019s\n\ncomplaint frames things differently.\n\n        Hardy repeatedly states that he was \u201cobviously in pain\u201d and sitting in\n\na \u201ccontorted position\u201d and that \u201canyone [would] see that [Hardy] was\n\ninjured in some way[.]\u201d Aplt. App I at 25\u201326. To support this factual picture,\n\n                                       16\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 17\n\n\n\nHardy alleges that Deputy Rabie did in fact ask, \u201cwhat happened to him.\u201d\n\nId. at 25. Hardy responded that he had fallen out of his wheelchair and\n\n\u201cverbally declared a medical emergency[.]\u201d Id.\n\n      According to the complaint, Deputy Rabie was independently aware\n\nthat something was wrong, Hardy said he was having a medical emergency,\n\nand Hardy explained why he was having an emergency. Further, Deputy\n\nRabie had no way of knowing that Hardy would be seen by a nurse after the\n\nshift change, so that fact could not have affected his subjective perception.\n\nSee Mata, 427 F.3d at 756 (\u201cEvents occurring subsequent to [a] complete\n\ndenial of medical care . . . have no bearing on whether [a defendant] was\n\ndeliberately indifferent at the time she refused to treat [a plaintiff].\u201d).\n\nTaking these alleged facts in the light most favorable to Hardy, as we must,\n\nwe conclude that Deputy Rabie was subjectively aware of a serious risk of\n\nharm and then \u201cdisregarded that risk, by failing to take reasonable\n\nmeasures to abate it.\u201d Callahan, 471 F.3d at 1159.\n\n                                       B\n\n      Now that we have determined that Hardy\u2019s constitutional rights were\n\nviolated, we consider whether these rights were clearly established. To\n\novercome qualified immunity, a right must be clearly established such that \u201ca\n\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d\n\nTruman, 1 F.4th at 1235 (citation omitted). \u201cA right is clearly established when\n\n                                      17\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138    Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 18\n\n\n\na Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision is on point, or if the clearly\n\nestablished weight of authority from other courts shows that the right must be\n\nas the plaintiff maintains.\u201d Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHowever, we need not find \u201cprecisely the same facts, and a prior case need not\n\nbe exactly parallel to the conduct here for the officials to have been on notice\n\nof clearly established law.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). What we look for is whether\n\n\u201ccourts have previously ruled that materially similar conduct was\n\nunconstitutional, or if \u2018a general constitutional rule already identified in the\n\ndecisional law [applies] with obvious clarity to the specific conduct\u2019 at issue.\u201d\n\nBuck, 549 F.3d at 1290 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Lanier,\n\n520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997)).\n\n      As a threshold matter, Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera argue that Hardy can only demonstrate clearly established law\n\nbased on four cases that he cited to the district court.7 They argue that the\n\nmagistrate judge and the district court improperly relied on four additional\n\ncases that were never raised by Hardy, and that our analysis is similarly\n\n\n\n\n      7 Quintana v. Santa Fe Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 973 F.3d 1022\n\n(10th Cir. 2020); Al Turki v. Robinson, 762 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2014); Est.\nof Booker v. Gomez, 745 F.3d 405 (10th Cir. 2014); Mata v.

Holloway, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff did not\n\nneed to put relevant cases into the district court record for those cases to be\n\nconsidered on appeal when deciding whether the law was clearly established.\n\n510 U.S. 510, 515 (1994).\n\n      Although Elder concerned the Ninth Circuit limiting the scope of its own\n\nreview, the principle applies equally to the proper scope of the district court\u2019s\n\nreview. Whether a legal right is clearly established \u201cpresents a question of\n\nlaw[.]\u201d Id. at 516. \u201cA court engaging in review of a qualified immunity\n\njudgment should therefore use its \u2018full knowledge of its own [and other\n\nrelevant] precedents.\u2019\u201d Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Davis v. Scherer, 468\n\nU.S. 183, 192 n.9 (1984)). Hardy has not waived any argument with respect to\n\nqualified immunity, and so, reviewing de novo, we will consider all relevant\n\nprecedent. See Cortez v. McCauley, 478 F.3d 1108, 1122 n.19 (10th Cir. 2007)\n\n(\u201cWhile it is true that Plaintiffs should cite to what constitutes clearly\n\nestablished law, we are not restricted to the cases cited by them.\u201d); Cox v.\n\n\n\n\n      8 Prince v.

Colorado, 218 F.3d 1205 (10th Cir. 2000).\n                                        19\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138     Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 20\n\n\n\nGlanz, 800 F.3d 1231, 1247 (10th Cir. 2015) (looking for case law not raised by\n\nthe plaintiff to determine whether her rights were clearly established \u201c[i]n the\n\ninterest of thoroughness\u201d).\n\n      Availing himself of our entire case law on appeal, Hardy raises numerous\n\non-point cases that apply to his circumstances. We conduct a brief survey of\n\nthe case law here, starting with Sealock, where we held that prison officials\n\nviolate an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights when they deliberately ignore\n\nrequests for necessary medical attention and cause that inmate significant\n\npain and suffering. 218 F.3d at 1209. In that case, the plaintiff woke up in the\n\nmiddle of the night and complained to prison officials of \u201ca crushing pain in his\n\nchest\u201d and said that he \u201cmight be having a heart attack.\u201d Id. at 1208. Prison\n\nofficials could see the plaintiff \u201cwas sweating, vomiting[,] and appeared very\n\npale[,]\u201d but told him that they wouldn\u2019t take him to a hospital because it was\n\n\u201csnowing outside and it would take time to warm up the prison van for\n\ntransportation.\u201d Id. at 1208, 1210. The plaintiff was eventually treated for a\n\nheart attack and made a full recovery, but this court still found that the official\n\nwho refused to take him to a hospital overnight acted with deliberate\n\nindifference. Id. at 1210.\n\n      The Tenth Circuit has since applied this principle to cases where\n\nplaintiffs suffered from less obvious instances of illness, but still experienced\n\nsignificant pain due to a delay in requested medical care. In Mata, the plaintiff\n\n                                        20\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1    Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 21\n\n\n\nwent to a prison infirmary in the evening because she was feeling severe chest\n\npain. 427 F.3d at 750. The nurse on duty did not give her a medical assessment\n\nand told her to return the next morning when the infirmary was open. Id. This\n\ncourt found that the nurse \u201crefused to fulfill her duty as gatekeeper in a\n\npotential cardiac emergency.\u201d Id. at 758.\n\n      In Olsen v. Layton Hills Mall, a plaintiff told jail officials when being\n\nbooked that he had OCD and needed medication to avoid panic attacks. 312\n\nF.3d 1304, 1310 (10th Cir. 2002). His medication was taken from him, and\n\nwhen he informed a jail official that he was having a panic attack and\n\nrequested help, the official did nothing in response. Id. This court refused to\n\ngrant the official qualified immunity on summary judgment, finding that he\n\n\u201cmay have known of\u2014and disregarded\u2014an excessive risk to [the plaintiff\u2019s]\n\nhealth.\u201d Id. at 1317.\n\n      More recently, in McCowan, we considered whether a police officer was\n\ndeliberately indifferent to a plaintiff\u2019s medical needs when the plaintiff\n\ncomplained of severe shoulder pain. 945 F.3d at 1280. The officer held the\n\nplaintiff at a police station and delayed taking the plaintiff to a detention\n\ncenter where he could get medical care, causing him to suffer \u201cup to several\n\nhours of excruciating pain.\u201d Id. at 1291. Even though the plaintiff did not\n\nspecifically request medical care, this court found that he had plausibly alleged\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1    Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 22\n\n\n\nthat the officer was deliberately indifferent because the plaintiff repeatedly\n\nstated he was in severe pain. Id. at 1292.\n\n      These are only some of the many Tenth Circuit cases where we have\n\nfound that prison officials display deliberate indifference by ignoring an\n\ninmate\u2019s reasonable requests for medical attention. See also Burke v. Regalado,\n\n935 F.3d 960, 994 (10th Cir. 2019) (denying qualified immunity for jail officials\n\nwho left plaintiff immobile in his cell and failed to render medical aid after\n\nplaintiff told them he was paralyzed); Prince, 28 F.4th at 1047\u201348 (10th Cir.\n\n2022) (denying qualified immunity to a nurse who did not give prescribed\n\nmedical care to an inmate). Even when inmates do not request medical\n\nattention, it is \u201cclearly established that when a detainee has obvious and\n\nserious medical needs, ignoring those needs necessarily violates the detainee\u2019s\n\nconstitutional rights.\u201d Quintana v. Santa Fe Cnty. Bd. of Commissioners, 973\n\nF.3d 1022, 1033 (10th Cir. 2020).\n\n      As such, we have on point precedent involving materially similar conduct\n\nto the actions of Deputy Rabie, who spoke with Hardy, observed his condition\n\nand symptoms, and heard him ask for medical assistance. Defendants can only\n\ndistinguish these cases by raising immaterial factual differences, such as the\n\nfact that none of them \u201cinvolve back pain from a fall that had already been\n\notherwise resolved.\u201d Op. Br. at 56\u201357. Given the alleged facts, however, we\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138    Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 23\n\n\n\nhave no trouble concluding that Deputy Rabie was on notice that his actions\n\nviolated Hardy\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\n        But these cases provide fewer clear parallels when it comes to Detention\n\nSpecialist DeHerrera, who was only aware that Hardy (or his cellmate) was\n\npressing the cell\u2019s emergency distress button. For Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera, we look to other precedents involving remote requests for medical\n\nhelp.\n\n        In Al-Turki, we considered the case of an inmate who used an intercom\n\nin his cell to call for help. 762 F.3d at 1191. The plaintiff, who was known to\n\nhave diabetes, told a correctional officer that \u201che was experiencing severe pain\n\nand nausea, and he asked to go to the medical center.\u201d Id. That officer then\n\ncalled the nurse on duty at the medical center, who said that \u201cshe would not\n\nsee [the plaintiff] because it was too late and because [his] complaint was not\n\nan emergency.\u201d Id. The plaintiff made two more requests for medical care, both\n\nof which were also ignored. Id. The next morning, he passed two kidney stones\n\nand completely recovered from his pain. Id. at 1192. This court found that the\n\n\n\n\n                                       23\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138    Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 24\n\n\n\nnurse in Al-Turki was not entitled to qualified immunity.9 Id. at 1195.\n\nAlthough she could not actually observe the plaintiff, \u201cDefendant was aware\n\nthat severe abdominal pain, particularly in someone with diabetes, may be a\n\nsign of any number of serious, life-threatening conditions.\u201d Id. at 1194.\n\nFurther, \u201cDefendant was also aware that she was the only medical staff person\n\non duty and that her decision to ignore Plaintiff\u2019s request for medical treatment\n\nwould leave him without medical assistance.\u201d Id. The defendant violated the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights because she was deliberately indifferent to\n\nwhat would have appeared to be a medical emergency based on the facts as she\n\nknew them at the time. Id.\n\n      We considered another intercom case in Lance v. Morris, this time\n\ninvolving an inmate who developed a painful and potentially dangerous\n\npriapism. 985 F.3d 787, 792 (10th Cir. 2021). Over three days, the plaintiff\n\nreported his symptoms to multiple jail officials. Id. At first, he used his\n\nintercom to call the jail\u2019s control tower and told one defendant \u201cthat he had\n\ntaken a pill and developed an erection that would not go away. But he did not\n\n\n\n\n      9 Defendants note that the correctional officer in Al-Turki was granted\n\nqualified immunity. But any comparison between the correctional officer in\nthat case and Detention Specialist DeHerrera is unwarranted because the\nofficer in Al-Turki did contact the medical center, and thus fulfilled his\ngatekeeper duties. 762 F.3d at 1191. Deputy Rabie and Detention Specialist\nDeHerrera are thus more analogous to the nurse, who did nothing in\nresponse to the plaintiff\u2019s request for aid.\n                                       24\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138    Document: 37-1     Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 25\n\n\n\ncomplain of pain or say that he needed to see a doctor or nurse[,]\u201d so the\n\ndefendant did not respond. Id. at 794. This court found that this defendant did\n\nnot act with deliberate indifference because of what he learned during the call.\n\nId. However, the plaintiff also called the control tower the next day while a\n\ndifferent defendant was on duty in the tower. Id. at 797. This time, the plaintiff\n\nreported \u201chis persistent erection, his need for medical attention, and the\n\nconsiderable pain he was experiencing.\u201d Id. (internal brackets and quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Based on those facts, this court refused to grant summary\n\njudgment as to this defendant based on qualified immunity, given \u201cthe\n\nevidence of the call\u201d to the control tower requesting medical attention as well\n\nas the defendant\u2019s \u201cview of the [plaintiff\u2019s cell]\u201d through a window. Id. at 798.\n\n      While these cases do not involve emergency call buttons, they\n\ndemonstrate that it is deliberate indifference for jail officials to ignore calls for\n\nhelp even where those officials have limited information. The defendants in Al-\n\nTurki and Lance had more information than Detention Specialist DeHerrera.\n\nBoth could get reports of symptoms over the intercom, and the defendant in\n\nAl-Turki knew the plaintiff had diabetes, while the defendant in Lance could\n\npartially see into the plaintiff\u2019s cell. But they also had far less information than\n\nthe defendants in our other deliberate indifference cases involving jail officials\n\nwho could interact with the plaintiffs firsthand. Even so, this court determined\n\nthat they exhibited deliberate indifference by not taking further action in light\n\n                                         25\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 26\n\n\n\nof the information that they had available to them. According to Hardy\u2019s\n\ncomplaint, Detention Specialist DeHerrera was only able to know if the\n\nemergency call button was pressed in Hardy\u2019s cell, nothing more. When\n\nDetention Specialist DeHerrera saw that it had been pressed multiple times,\n\nHardy claims that he chose to do nothing.\n\n      This court has established a \u201cgeneral constitutional rule\u201d against\n\nignoring an inmate\u2019s requests for emergency medical attention that applies\n\nwith \u201cobvious clarity\u201d to Detention Specialist DeHerrera\u2019s actions. Buck, 549\n\nF.3d at 1290. Defendants urge against finding that a rule applies with obvious\n\nclarity \u201cabsent a high degree of factual similarity[.]\u201d Op. Br. at 46. The\n\nSupreme Court has indeed cautioned courts \u201cnot to define clearly established\n\nlaw at a high level of generality\u201d and to look to the \u201cviolative nature of\n\nparticular conduct[.]\u201d Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.S. 7, 12 (2015) (citation\n\nomitted). However, the question is not whether there is factual similarity, but\n\nwhether \u201cthe unlawfulness of the officer\u2019s conduct \u2018does not follow immediately\n\nfrom the conclusion that [the rule] was firmly established.\u2019\u201d D.C. v. Wesby, 583\n\nU.S. 48, 64 (2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483\n\nU.S. 635, 641 (1987)).\n\n      We differ from the dissent because we consider this question in light of\n\nthe information available to Detention Specialist DeHerrera at the time he was\n\nin the control tower. In that context, the unlawfulness of his conduct flows\n\n                                      26\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1    Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 27\n\n\n\nnaturally from our clearly established law on deliberate indifference.\n\nDetention Specialist DeHerrera ignored a call from an emergency distress\n\nbutton that could have been \u201ca sign of any number of serious, life-threatening\n\nconditions.\u201d Al-Turki, 762 F.3d at 1194. Under these circumstances, and as a\n\ngatekeeper to medical care and emergency response, Detention Specialist\n\nDeHerrera would have been on notice that ignoring requests for emergency\n\nassistance was a violation of an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights. The Tenth\n\nCircuit has made it \u201csufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have\n\nunderstood that\u201d this particular conduct was unlawful.10 Mullenix, 577 U.S. at\n\n11 (citation omitted).\n\n                                       IV\n\n      Neither Detention Specialist DeHerrera nor Deputy Rabie can claim\n\nqualified immunity based on the allegations contained in Hardy\u2019s complaint.\n\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM the ruling of the district court and REMAND for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n      10 We also note that the Seventh Circuit has made this same\ndetermination regarding emergency call buttons. See Velez v. Johnson, 395\nF.3d 732, 736 (7th Cir. 2005). Although we do not consider this enough to\ndemonstrate a clearly established weight of authority from other circuits, it\nis nonetheless persuasive that our sister circuit found this constitutional\nright to be clearly established based solely on the principles of deliberate\nindifference outlined by the Supreme Court in Farmer v. Brennan. Id.\n(citing 511 U.S. 825, 833 (1970)).\n                                       27\n\f     Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 28\n\n\n\nRalph Marcus Hardy v. Deputy Rabie and Deputy DeHerrera, No. 24-1138\nBACHARACH, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n        The district court denied the motions to dismiss by Deputies Rabie\n\nand DeHerrera, and the majority upholds these rulings. I agree with the\n\ndistrict court and the majority on the claims involving Deputy Rabie, but\n\nnot those involving Deputy DeHerrera. In my view, Deputy DeHerrera\u2019s\n\nalleged violation of the Constitution wouldn\u2019t have been clearly\n\nestablished; and the absence of a clearly established violation would\n\ntrigger qualified immunity. So I would reverse the denial of Deputy\n\nDeHerrera\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\n1.      The plaintiff must overcome qualified immunity based on his\n        allegations in the complaint.\n\n        Mr. Hardy claims deliberate indifference to a serious medical\n\ncondition. For this claim, the district court had to credit Mr. Hardy\u2019s well-\n\npleaded factual allegations. Sanchez v. Guzman, 105 F.4th 1285, 1299\n\n(10th Cir. 2024). These allegations state that\n\n        \u2022     Mr. Hardy fell from his wheelchair,\n\n        \u2022     his cellmate pressed the emergency button in their cell,\n\n        \u2022     Deputy DeHerrera ignored the emergency signal from\n              Mr. Hardy\u2019s cell, and\n\n        \u2022     Mr. Hardy suffered serious pain while waiting for medical\n              attention.\n\nCrediting these allegations, the district court needed to decide whether the\n\nalleged facts had stated a facially plausible claim. Strain v. Regalado, 977\n\f     Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 29\n\n\n\nF.3d 984, 989 (10th Cir. 2020). Once the district court ruled, we would\n\nconduct de novo review. Id.\n\n        But we conduct this review against the backdrop of Deputy\n\nDeHerrera\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity. Given the assertion of\n\nqualified immunity, we consider the objective reasonableness of Deputy\n\nDeHerrera\u2019s conduct as alleged in the complaint. Hemry v. Ross, 62 F.4th\n\n1248, 1253 (10th Cir. 2023). For this inquiry, we consider\n\n        \u2022     whether Mr. Hardy has alleged facts that would entail a\n              violation of a constitutional right and\n\n        \u2022     whether this right had been clearly established.\n\nEst. of Lockett ex rel. Lockett v. Fallin, 841 F.3d 1098, 1107 (10th Cir.\n\n2016). A right is clearly established if the Supreme Court, the Tenth\n\nCircuit, or the weight of out-of-circuit authority has\n\n        \u2022     held that \u201cmaterially similar conduct was unconstitutional\u201d or\n\n        \u2022     identified a rule that applies \u201cwith obvious clarity\u201d to the facts.\n\nBuck v. City of Albuquerque, 549 F.3d 1269, 1290 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\n(quoting United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997)).\n\n2.      Our precedents wouldn\u2019t clearly establish a constitutional\n        violation unless the defendant had seen or heard about a\n        prisoner\u2019s medical condition.\n\n        For the claim itself, Mr. Hardy could prevail only if\n\n        \u2022     he incurred a serious medical condition and\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 30\n\n\n\n      \u2022     Deputy DeHerrera knew of, and disregarded, an excessive risk\n            to health.\n\nDeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 975 (10th Cir. 2001). As the majority\n\nexplains, Mr. Hardy plausibly alleged a serious medical condition. Maj.\n\nOp. at 10. For Deputy DeHerrera, we may assume for the sake of argument\n\nthat he knowingly disregarded an excessive risk to Mr. Hardy\u2019s health.\n\nEven with that assumption, however, a constitutional violation wouldn\u2019t be\n\nclearly established because Mr. Hardy doesn\u2019t allege that\n\n      \u2022     anyone discussed the fall with Deputy DeHerrera or\n\n      \u2022     Deputy DeHerrera observed Mr. Hardy.\n\n      The missing allegations resemble the circumstances in Lance v.\n\nMorris, 985 F.3d 787 (10th Cir. 2021). There a prisoner developed a\n\npriapism, which is a persistent, painful erection. Id. at 792. The prisoner\n\ncalled the control tower, stating that he had developed an erection that\n\nwouldn\u2019t go away. Id. at 794. But the prisoner didn\u2019t complain of pain or\n\nsay that he needed to see a doctor or nurse. Id. We concluded that even\n\nthough the condition was serious, the guard in the control tower hadn\u2019t\n\nacted with deliberate indifference in the absence of evidence about what he\n\nmight have seen or heard. Id. at 795.\n\n      Granted, we held that another officer wasn\u2019t entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity at the summary-judgment stage given evidence that the officer\n\nhad talked to the prisoner about the priapism and could see into the cell.\n\n                                        3\n\f    Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 31\n\n\n\nId. at 797\u201398; see Maj. Op. at 24\u201325. Here, however, there\u2019s no allegation\n\nthat Deputy DeHerrera saw Mr. Hardy or heard that he was in medical\n\ndistress. So this holding in Lance wouldn\u2019t clearly show a need for medical\n\ncare when the defendant hadn\u2019t talked to the inmate or seen into his cell.\n\n       Mr. Hardy and the district court have pointed to numerous other\n\ncases recognizing constitutional violations. In all of these cases, however,\n\nthe defendants had either observed the injured prisoners or been told about\n\ntheir medical conditions. These cases consist of\n\n       \u2022     Sealock v. Colorado, where we denied qualified immunity to\n             both a defendant who witnessed the symptoms of a heart attack\n             and a defendant who had been told the plaintiff was\n             experiencing chest pains, 218 F.3d 1205, 1210\u201312 (10th Cir.\n             2000),\n\n       \u2022     Olsen v. Layton Hills Mall, where we denied qualified\n             immunity when the plaintiff notified the official of a panic\n             attack, 312 F.3d 1304, 1316\u201317 (10th Cir. 2002),\n\n       \u2022     Mata v. Saiz, where we denied qualified immunity when a nurse\n             had personally observed, and spoken with, the plaintiff, 427\n             F.3d 745, 756\u201359 (10th Cir. 2005),\n\n       \u2022     Al-Turki v. Robinson, where we denied qualified immunity\n             when the official had been told repeatedly about the plaintiff\u2019s\n             severe pain, 762 F.3d 1188, 1191 (10th Cir. 2014), 1\n\n       \u2022     Estate of Booker v. Gomez, where we denied qualified\n             immunity when the officials had placed the plaintiff in a\n1\n      The majority also relies on this case, pointing to the treatment of a\nprison nurse. Maj. Op. at 23\u201324 & n.9. But the nurse was told that plaintiff\nhad experienced severe abdominal pain and had requested medical care. Al-\nTurki, 762 F.3d at 1191. According to the complaint, Deputy DeHerrera\nhad no comparable information as to the nature of the emergency request\nfrom Mr. Hardy\u2019s cell.\n                                        4\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 32\n\n\n\n            chokehold, tasered him, and put him in a holding cell, 745 F.3d\n            405, 414\u201315, 434 (10th Cir. 2014),\n\n      \u2022     McCowan v. Morales, where we denied qualified immunity\n            when the plaintiff had repeatedly informed the official of a\n            shoulder injury, 945 F.3d 1276, 1292 (10th Cir. 2019),\n\n      \u2022     Quintana v. Santa Fe County Board of Commissioners, where\n            we denied qualified immunity when an official had known that\n            the plaintiff was vomiting blood, 973 F.3d 1022, 1030\u201331 (10th\n            Cir. 2020),\n\n      \u2022     Paugh v. Uintah County, where we denied qualified immunity\n            when the officials were aware of symptoms that had obviously\n            been serious, 47 F.4th 1139, 1157\u201365 (10th Cir. 2022), and\n\n      \u2022     Prince v. Sheriff of Carter County, where we denied qualified\n            immunity when the official had (1) heard the plaintiff using\n            incoherent phrases and (2) ignored a doctor\u2019s orders concerning\n            the treatment, 28 F.4th 1033, 1046 (10th Cir. 2022).\n\nIn all of these cases, the prison official knew of the medical conditions by\n\n      \u2022     observing the injured or ill prisoners or\n\n      \u2022     being told about the conditions.\n\n      The same is true of the opinions that Mr. Hardy cites from other\n\ncircuits: In each opinion, the guard had either observed the prisoner in\n\nmedical distress or been told about it. See Williams v. City of Yazoo, 41\n\nF.4th 416, 423\u201324 (5th Cir. 2022) (stating that the plaintiff had adequately\n\nalleged the defendants\u2019 knowledge of the medical condition based on what\n\nthey had been told and their knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s diagnosis);\n\nPhillips v. Roane Cnty., 534 F.3d 531, 540\u201341 (6th Cir. 2008) (observing\n\nthat the plaintiff was being held in a cell that the officials would have\n\n                                      5\n\f  Appellate Case: 24-1138   Document: 37-1   Date Filed: 08/04/2025   Page: 33\n\n\n\nunderstood as reserved for inmates undergoing medical crises); Schaub v.\n\nVonWald, 638 F.3d 905, 915\u201316 (8th Cir. 2011) (holding that an official\n\nwas aware of serious medical needs when notified by a doctor).\n\n      We lack any allegations about a similar observation or statement to\n\nDeputy DeHerrera about Mr. Hardy\u2019s need for medical attention. To the\n\ncontrary, Mr. Hardy argues only that Deputy DeHerrera saw and ignored an\n\nemergency notification from Mr. Hardy\u2019s cell. But Mr. Hardy hasn\u2019t cited\n\nany opinions recognizing a constitutional violation without the official\u2019s\n\nobservation or notification of a prisoner who is injured or sick. As a result,\n\nDeputy DeHerrera\u2019s alleged constitutional violation wouldn\u2019t have\n\ninvolved a clearly established constitutional right. And in the absence of a\n\nclearly established right, I would reverse the denial of Deputy DeHerrera\u2019s\n\nmotion to dismiss.\n\n\n\n\n                                      6"

This appeal concerns the\nconsequent suit brought by the Carroll family and Wilken against the boat designer,\nmanufacturer, and seller (collectively \u201cBrunswick\u201d) for defective design, failure to\nwarn, negligence, and wrongful death. After trial, the jury returned a verdict in\nBrunswick\u2019s favor. On appeal, the plaintiffs assert four district court1 errors. For\nthe reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n\n       On May 2, 2020, Brent Solomon\u2014the Pajivo\u2019s primary caretaker\u2014Carroll,\nWilken, and one other individual ended their day of boating on the Lake of the\nOzarks with a stop at the Bridgeview Marina to refuel. Once they had finished\nrefueling, Solomon briefly turned on fans that blow fuel vapor out of the engine\ncompartment but failed to raise the engine hatch to ensure gasoline fumes were not\npresent. Solomon then started the engine, triggering an explosion.\n\n       The Carroll family and Wilken sued Brunswick, alleging defective design,\nfailure to warn, negligence, and wrongful death. While the parties agreed that the\nexplosion occurred due to gasoline fumes in the boat\u2019s right engine, they disputed\nhow the gasoline fumes got there. The plaintiffs faulted the fuel system design,\npointing out that the fuel fill hose, which fed fuel into the engine tanks, was bent.\nThey alleged that the bend caused the hose to weaken and crack over time, which in\nturn allowed gasoline to leak from the hose into the engine compartment. For its\npart, Brunswick asserted that the explosion resulted from a combination of failure to\nperform critical maintenance and user errors on the day of the explosion.\n\n\n      1\n        The Honorable Brian C. Wimes, United States District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f       The plaintiffs retained J. Michael Hunter, a marine surveyor, to testify about\npossible sources of fuel leaks and ignition that caused or contributed to the\nexplosion. Hunter had inspected three other Brunswick boats, which contained\ncracks in the fuel fill hose. One of those boats\u2014the Schroeder\u2014had exploded in\n2008, leading to litigation against Brunswick. In this case, the Pajivo\u2019s fuel fill hose\nwas never recovered, but Hunter posited that cracks in the hose allowed gasoline to\nleak into the engine compartment.\n\n       Prior to trial, Brunswick filed a motion in limine to exclude \u201c[e]vidence,\n[i]nference or [a]rguments regarding other [b]oat [e]xplosions,\u201d claiming that\nevidence of other boat explosions was \u201cirrelevant, dissimilar, and would result in\nconfusion to the jury.\u201d Specifically, Brunswick sought to exclude Hunter\u2019s\ntestimony pertaining to the Schroeder explosion and Brunswick and Hunter\u2019s joint\ninspection of the Schroeder\u2019s cracked fuel fill hose during the subsequent litigation.\nThe plaintiffs countered that the Schroeder explosion constituted admissible other-\nsimilar-incident (\u201cOSI\u201d) evidence because the Pajivo and Schroeder were the same\nmodel and the factual scenarios were substantially similar. The district court granted\nBrunswick\u2019s motion and instructed the plaintiffs that Hunter could \u201ctestify as an\nexpert related to the incident on this boat\u201d but not about the Schroeder explosion or\nBrunswick\u2019s knowledge of the Schroeder\u2019s cracked fuel fill hose. The plaintiffs\u2019\ncounsel assured the district court that Hunter would not mention the Schroeder\nexplosion or subsequent litigation and would testify only that he discovered a leak\nin the Schroeder\u2019s fuel fill hose.\n\n       The case proceeded to a jury trial. During voir dire, Brunswick attempted to\nstrike the only two black venirepersons\u2014Juror No. 13 and Juror No. 21. Brunswick\nmoved to strike Juror No. 21 for cause, alleging that he was sleeping during voir\ndire. The district court denied that attempted strike, explaining that it had not\nobserved Juror No. 21 sleeping. Brunswick later used a peremptory strike to remove\nJuror No. 13, explaining that her occupation as a registered nurse specializing in\noncology might unduly influence other jurors regarding doctors\u2019 testimony about\npredeath pain and suffering. The plaintiffs raised a Batson challenge, see Batson v.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fKentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), arguing that Brunswick\u2019s proffered reasons for\nstriking the black prospective juror were pretextual, but the district court denied that\nchallenge.\n\n       The parties called various witnesses over the course of an eight-day trial. As\nrelevant here, the plaintiffs called Hunter as an expert witness to testify about the\nPajivo explosion. Despite the district court\u2019s order barring testimony about the\nSchroeder explosion, Hunter testified that the Schroeder had exploded and that\nBrunswick\u2019s counsel had inspected the Schroeder. Brunswick immediately moved\nfor a mistrial, requesting in the alternative that the district court strike Hunter\u2019s\ntestimony regarding the Schroeder. The district court did not grant Brunswick\u2019s\nmistrial motion, but it instructed the jury that Hunter\u2019s testimony and evidence\nrelated to the Schroeder \u201cis excluded . . . and is not to be considered by you in your\ndeliberations.\u201d\n\n       However, that was not the district court\u2019s last intervention related to the\nexcluded evidence. During closing arguments, Brunswick\u2019s counsel asserted that\nplaintiffs \u201chaven\u2019t met their burden of proof for liability,\u201d asking, \u201c[where are] all\nthe other explosions.\u201d The plaintiffs objected and requested the district court\n\u201cinstruct the jury that we were not allowed to present evidence of other explosions,\u201d\nor that they be permitted to argue \u201c[t]hat there have been other explosions of\n[Brunswick] boats.\u201d The district court denied both requests, but instructed the jury\nto \u201cdisregard the last comments made by the defense attorney.\u201d Ultimately, the jury\nreturned a verdict in Brunswick\u2019s favor on all claims.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the district court erred in denying their\nBatson challenge. They also raise several challenges to the district court\u2019s exclusion\nof evidence and statements pertaining to other similar incidents.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                  A. Batson challenge\n\n       We begin with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the district court erroneously denied\ntheir Batson challenge. We review the district court\u2019s Batson determination for clear\nerror, see United States v. Johnson, 954 F.3d 1106, 1111 (8th Cir. 2020), reversing\nif we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court\u2019s finding\nis mistaken,\u201d United States v. Swinney, 970 F.2d 494, 497 (8th Cir. 1992). To prevail\non a Batson challenge, the party opposing the strike must establish a prima facie\ncase of discrimination and show that the proponent\u2019s proffered reasons for the strike\nwere a pretext for race discrimination. United States v. Maxwell, 473 F.3d 868, 871\n(8th Cir. 2007).\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that they have established pretext because Brunswick\u2019s\nproffered reason for striking Juror No. 13 was unreasonable. We must assess \u201chow\nreasonable, or how improbable, [Brunswick\u2019s] explanations\u201d were and \u201cwhether the\nproffered rationale [had] some basis in accepted trial strategy.\u201d Miller-El v.\nCockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 339 (2003). A venireperson\u2019s occupation provides a\nreasonable ground for a peremptory strike that has a basis in accepted trial strategy.\nSee Maxwell, 473 F.3d at 872 (upholding strike where juror\u2019s employment made\njuror more sympathetic to the opponent); United States v. Velazquez-Rivera, 366\nF.3d 661, 666 (8th Cir. 2004) (upholding strike where the juror was struck, in part,\nbecause she was a nurse). Here, Brunswick\u2019s counsel reasonably explained that he\nstruck Juror No. 13 due to her medical background as an oncology nurse, which he\nthoroughly explored during voir dire through questions about her medical\nexperience and whether her medical training might lead her to favor one side\u2019s\nmedical testimony. Because this case involved a claim \u201cthat the decedent suffered\nfrom predeath pain and suffering,\u201d Brunswick\u2019s counsel concluded that Juror No.\n13\u2019s occupation as a registered nurse specializing in oncology might unduly\ninfluence other jurors regarding the doctors\u2019 testimony about predeath pain and\nsuffering. Additionally, she might be unduly sympathetic to the plaintiffs\u2019 side of\nthe case, due to her exposure to pain and suffering as an oncology nurse. Thus,\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fBrunswick\u2019s explanation was \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201c[based] in accepted trial strategy.\u201d\nSee Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 339.\n\n       In addition, the plaintiffs contend that the strike was pretextual because\nBrunswick did not attempt to strike a similarly situated white panelist\u2014Juror No. 8.\nSee Flowers v. Mississippi, 588 U.S. 284, 287-88 (2019); Devoil-El v. Groose, 160\nF.3d 1184, 1187 (8th Cir. 1998). But here, venirepersons 8 and 13 had a significant\nand relevant difference: during voir dire Juror No. 8 stated he had worked for\nGeneral Motors and recognized the importance of owners performing maintenance\non cars manufactured by General Motors. Brunswick\u2019s defense rested on the theory\nthat \u201cno critical basic maintenance was done on this boat [in two decades]\u201d and \u201cno\nfuel system inspection was ever performed.\u201d Thus, Juror No. 8\u2019s employment with\nGeneral Motors and statement during voir dire that owners should perform \u201ccritical\nmaintenance\u201d indicated that he might attribute the explosion to a lack of maintenance\nrather than a design flaw. Though both Juror No. 8 and No. 13 worked in medical\nfields, Juror No. 13 lacked the employment history and views on maintenance that\nmade Juror No. 8 a favorable juror for Brunswick. See Groose, 160 F.3d at 1187\n(upholding a finding that the proffered reasons were nondiscriminatory where\n\u201cCaucasian jurors sharing the same characteristics were not removed,\u201d \u201cbecause the\ncombination of characteristics was different in the non-stricken venirepersons\u201d).\nJuror No. 8 possessed relevant characteristics that distinguished him from Juror No.\n13. See id. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in rejecting the\nplaintiffs\u2019 Batson challenge.\n\n                                 B. Similar Incidents\n\n      We now turn to Carroll\u2019s remaining challenges, which all pertain to the district\ncourt\u2019s exclusion of evidence or statements pertaining to other similar incidents\n(\u201cOSI\u201d). First, the plaintiffs claim that the district court erred by excluding their\nevidence of the Schroeder explosion and litigation. \u201cThe decision whether to admit\nsimilar-incident evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the district court\nand we will not overturn the decision to admit OSI evidence absent a clear and\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fprejudicial abuse of discretion.\u201d Adams v. Toyota Motor Corp., 867 F.3d 903, 911\n(8th Cir. 2017) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cThere are no hard\nor fast rules as to what degree of similarity there must be to make the evidence\nadmissible.\u201d Henwood v. Chaney, 156 F.2d 392, 397 (8th Cir. 1946). Indeed, \u201c[t]he\nsubstantial similarity analysis is \u2018case specific\u2019 and fact-intensive.\u201d Scott v. Dyno\nNobel, Inc., 108 F.4th 615, 632 (8th Cir. 2024). In general, the other similar\nincidents must be \u201csufficiently similar in time, place or circumstances to be\nprobative.\u201d Thomas v. Chrysler Corp., 717 F.2d 1223, 1225 (8th. Cir. 1983).\nAdditionally, courts may bar evidence of other incidents when the conditions of the\nproducts are dissimilar. See, e.g., id. (affirming exclusion of other accidents where\nthe appellant failed to demonstrate that the vans were in similar condition).\n\n       The plaintiffs claim that the district court\u2019s exclusion of the Schroeder\nexplosion and related litigation was erroneous because the boats, explosions, and\ncauses in the Schroeder case and this one were substantially similar. The boats were\nthe same model (albeit slightly different model years), had the same type of fuel fill\nhose, routed the fuel fill hoses the same way, were on the Lake of the Ozarks, and\nexperienced an explosion at or around the time of refueling. But the plaintiffs failed\nto show that the Pajivo and the Schroeder were in similar condition when the\nexplosions occurred.2 The plaintiffs offered no proof concerning the mileage,\nmaintenance, or the condition of the Schroeder when it exploded. Although the\nplaintiffs are correct that our precedent does not always require parties produce proof\nof \u201cmaintenance history,\u201d that precedent confirms that the boat\u2019s condition at the\ntime of explosion is relevant. See, e.g., Adams, 867 F.3d at 913 (requiring proof of\nsimilar conditions at the time of the incident\u2014namely, similar vehicle mileage).\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The plaintiffs contend that Brunswick did not raise this argument in its\nmotion in limine. We disagree. In their motion in limine, Brunswick argued that\nintroducing evidence of boats with \u201cunknown mechanical histories,\u201d and \u201cunknown\ncauses and origins of the fires/explosions\u201d would prejudice the jury against it.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fAccordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion 3 in excluding evidence of\nthe Schroeder explosion and litigation.\n\n        Second, the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by striking Hunter\u2019s\ntestimony during trial regarding the Schroeder as a sanction for Hunter\u2019s violation\nof its order. A district court\u2019s imposition of a sanction for a violation of its order is\nreviewed for abuse of discretion, Chambers v. Nasco, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 55 (1991)\nand is given \u201csubstantial deference,\u201d Willhite v. Collins, 459 F.3d 866, 869 (8th Cir.\n2006). To impose a sanction, the court need not find bad faith by the violating party.\nSee Stevenson v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 354 F.3d 739, 745 (8th Cir. 2004).\n\n       We recently affirmed a sanction imposed by a district court where counsel\nelicited testimony at odds with the district court\u2019s orders on motions in limine,\namongst other conduct. RightCHOICE Managed Care, Inc. v. Hosp. Partners, Inc.,\n109 F.4th 1054, 1060 (8th Cir. 2024). Here too, the district court acted well within\nits discretion in finding a violation of its order and fashioning an appropriate\nsanction. Hunter\u2019s testimony violated the district court\u2019s order by stating that the\nSchroeder exploded and that Brunswick\u2019s counsel had inspected the Schroeder. The\ndistrict court recognized that those comments violated its order but chose to sanction\nwith restraint. Instead of granting a mistrial, it struck Hunter\u2019s testimony about the\nSchroeder while still admitting his testimony and evidence regarding the other two\ncomparison vessels. Altogether, we detect no abuse of discretion in the district\ncourt\u2019s sanction.\n\n      Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the district court erred by precluding them\nfrom introducing evidence of the Schroeder explosion as a remedy for the comment\nduring closing argument by Brunswick\u2019s counsel. To constitute reversible error,\nstatements made by counsel in closing argument must be \u201cplainly unwarranted and\n\n      3\n       Brunswick argues that the plaintiffs did not preserve this OSI issue for\nappeal, and that therefore we should review for plain error. We need not address\nthis argument, because the plaintiff\u2019s claim fails under an abuse of discretion\nstandard.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fclearly injurious.\u201d Hofer v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 981 F.2d 377, 385 (8th Cir. 1992);\nsee City of Malden v. Union Elec. Co., 887 F.2d 157, 164 (8th Cir. 1989). We will\nnot disturb a district court\u2019s ruling on comments made during closing arguments\nunless the district court abused its discretion. Vanskike v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 725\nF.2d 1146, 1149 (8th Cir. 1984). We review for an abuse of discretion because \u201c[t]he\ndistrict court is in a better position to determine whether prejudice has resulted from\na closing argument.\u201d Burroughs v. Mackie Moving Sys. Corp., 690 F.3d 1047, 1051\n(8th Cir. 2012).\n\n       Here, even though Brunswick\u2019s counsel\u2019s comment\u2014\u201cw[h]ere [are] all the\nother explosions\u201d\u2014may have prejudiced the plaintiffs if uncured, the district court\ndid take curative action. See Gilster v. Primebank, 747 F.3d 1007, 1011-12 (8th Cir.\n2014). Following the comment, the plaintiffs asked the district court to \u201cinstruct the\njury to disregard his last comments.\u201d The district court did just that, curing \u201cany\nprejudice that might have been caused by the comment.\u201d See Harrison v. Purdy\nBros. Trucking Co., Inc., 312 F.3d 346, 353 (8th Cir. 2002) (finding similar\ninstruction cured any prejudice from counsel\u2019s reference to pre-trial settlement\ndiscussions in closing argument); Lockley v. Deere & Co., 933 F.2d 1378, 1388-89\n(8th Cir. 1991) (holding court\u2019s similar admonition to jury cured any prejudice from\ncounsel\u2019s reference to a gross sale figure where court had informed counsel that such\na figure could not be used to show defendant\u2019s current net worth). Therefore,\ndetecting no abuse of discretion, the plaintiffs\u2019 final argument also fails.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-"

RAINBOW REAL INVESTORS, LP v. RED OAK\n     VILLAGE CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION, INC.\n\n      BARNES, Presiding Judge.\n\n      In this case arising from claims of continuing nuisance and trespass, the trial\n\ncourt denied the motion to open default judgment filed by defendant Rainbow Real\n\nInvestors, LP (\u201cRainbow\u201d) and subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe plaintiff Red Oak Village Condominium Association, Inc. (\u201cAssociation\u201d).\n\nRainbow now appeals these rulings. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n\n      The record reflects that the Association is a domestic non-profit corporation\n\nand the condominium association for Red Oak Village (\u201cVillage\u201d) located in Athens-\n\nClarke County, Georgia, and the Association maintains the common areas of the\n\nVillage, including the parking lot, landscaping, and stormwater drainage facilities.\n\fRainbow owns the property adjacent to the Village and leases it to a skilled nursing\n\nand rehabilitation center. Rainbow\u2019s property is uphill from the Village, and Rainbow\n\ndoes not own a drainage easement over the Village\u2019s common areas.\n\n      On April 11, 2023, the Association sued Rainbow, alleging that as a result of\n\nRainbow\u2019s acts and omissions, \u201cthe flow of water from [Rainbow\u2019s] property has been\n\nconcentrated, increased by artificial means, and diverted onto the common [areas] of\n\n[the] Village,\u201d causing ongoing erosion and sedimentation problems. The Association\n\nasserted claims for continuing nuisance and trespass, and it sought damages, attorney\n\nfees under OCGA \u00a7 13-6-11, and permanent injunctive relief.\n\n      On April 18, 2023, Rainbow was served with the summons and complaint.\n\nBecause Rainbow did not timely file an answer, the lawsuit went into automatic\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fdefault. See OCGA \u00a7 9-11-55 (a).1 Following entry of the automatic default, Rainbow\n\ndid not open the default as a matter of right within 15 days. See id.\n\n      On June 8, 2023, the Association moved for default judgment, and the trial\n\ncourt granted the motion on July 17, 2023. In its order, the trial court concluded that\n\nas a result of its default, Rainbow admitted that it owned the property adjacent to the\n\nAssociation, and that it had concentrated, increased by artificial means, and diverted\n\n\n      1\n        See OCGA \u00a7 9-11-55 (a) provides:\n             If in any case an answer has not been filed within the time required\n      by this chapter, the case shall automatically become in default unless the\n      time for filing the answer has been extended as provided by law. The\n      default may be opened as a matter of right by the filing of such defenses\n      within 15 days of the day of default, upon the payment of costs. If the\n      case is still in default after the expiration of the period of 15 days, the\n      plaintiff at any time thereafter shall be entitled to verdict and judgment\n      by default, in open court or in chambers, as if every item and paragraph\n      of the complaint or other original pleading were supported by proper\n      evidence, without the intervention of a jury, unless the action is one ex\n      delicto or involves unliquidated damages, in which event the plaintiff\n      shall be required to introduce evidence and establish the amount of\n      damages before the court without a jury, with the right of the defendant\n      to introduce evidence as to damages and the right of either to move for\n      a new trial in respect of such damages; provided, however, in the event\n      a defendant, though in default, has placed damages in issue by filing a\n      pleading raising such issue, either party shall be entitled, upon demand,\n      to a jury trial of the issue as to damages. An action based upon open\n      account shall not be considered one for unliquidated damages within the\n      meaning of this Code section.\n                                           3\n\fthe flow of water onto the common areas of the Village, which resulted in erosion and\n\nsedimentation problems in those areas. The trial court further concluded that based\n\non those admissions, Rainbow was liable for committing a trespass and creating a\n\ncontinuing nuisance that infringed upon the Association\u2019s property rights, entitling\n\nthe Association to damages, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. The trial court\n\nreserved ruling on the \u201camount of damages and the nature of the remedy to abate the\n\nnuisance and trespass,\u201d which would be determined in a future hearing.\n\n      On March 21, 2024, the Association moved for summary judgment, contending\n\nthat as a result of the entry of default judgment on liability, Rainbow had admitted\n\neach and every material allegation of the complaint, and based on the affidavits and\n\nexhibits it was submitting with its motion, there were no genuine issues of material\n\nfact as to the amount of damages owed to the Association and its entitlement to\n\ninjunctive relief. Among other damages, the Association sought to recover $98,650\n\nin estimated costs to remediate and prevent the excessive stormwater runoff that\n\ncontinued to flow from Rainbow\u2019s property onto the Village\u2019s common areas.2\n\n      2\n         See generally Ga. Northeastern R. Co. v. Lusk, 277 Ga. 245, 247 (2) (587 SE2d\n643) (2003) (noting that under Georgia law, the cost to repair or restore land may be\nan appropriate measure of damages in a nuisance action); Sumitomo Corp. of America\nv.

App. 703, 708 (4) (569 SE2d 608) (2002) (\u201c[T]he cost of repair often\n                                          4\n\f       Although Rainbow was aware in July 2023 that a default judgment had been\n\nentered against it, it did not move to open the default at that time. Approximately nine\n\nmonths later, on April 22, 2024, Rainbow filed its motion to open the default\n\njudgment pursuant to OCGA \u00a7 9-11-55 (b),3 contending that its failure to answer was\n\nthe result of excusable neglect and that a proper case had been made for opening\n\ndefault because it relied on its tenant to undertake a defense of the lawsuit on its behalf\n\nbased on an indemnification provision in their lease agreement. That same day,\n\nRainbow also filed a brief in opposition to the Association\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment, contending, among other things, that the Association\u2019s engineering expert\n\nfailed to lay a proper foundation for admission of the written estimate of remediation\n\n\n\nhas been held to be an appropriate measure of damages in cases involving a continuing\nnuisance or trespass.\u201d) (citations and punctuation omitted).\n       3\n        OCGA \u00a7 9-11-55 (b) provides:\n              At any time before final judgment, the court, in its discretion,\n       upon payment of costs, may allow the default to be opened for\n       providential cause preventing the filing of required pleadings or for\n       excusable neglect or where the judge, from all the facts, shall determine\n       that a proper case has been made for the default to be opened, on terms\n       to be fixed by the court. In order to allow the default to be thus opened,\n       the showing shall be made under oath, shall set up a meritorious defense,\n       shall offer to plead instanter, and shall announce ready to proceed with\n       the trial.\n                                            5\n\fcosts prepared by a third-party landscaping company or for his expert opinion that the\n\nestimated cost was reasonable and necessary to remediate the excessive stormwater\n\nrunoff. Rainbow also submitted affidavits from the former and current maintenance\n\ndirectors of its tenant, asserting that the affidavits created a genuine issue of material\n\nfact as to whether the Association was entitled to any recovery and as to the amount\n\nof damages.\n\n      The trial court conducted a hearing on the motions to open the default\n\njudgment and for summary judgment. Following the hearing, the trial court denied\n\nRainbow\u2019s motion to open the default judgment, concluding that Rainbow failed to\n\nshow either excusable neglect or a proper case for opening the default. As to excusable\n\nneglect, the trial court determined that Rainbow failed to demonstrate that it was\n\ndiligent or had a reasonable basis for relying on supposed assurances from its tenant\n\nthat the tenant would handle the lawsuit. As to a proper case for opening the default,\n\nthe trial court found that opening the default would cause significant prejudice to the\n\nAssociation in light of the ongoing nuisance and trespass; that the Association had\n\nacted promptly to obtain a default judgment; and that Rainbow had failed to act\n\npromptly to open the default upon learning that an answer had not been filed.\n\n\n                                            6\n\f      By separate order, the trial court granted the Association\u2019s motion for summary\n\njudgment and awarded the Association compensatory damages, attorney fees under\n\nOCGA \u00a7 13-6-11, and permanent injunctive relief. Among other things, the trial court\n\nconcluded that as a result of the default, Rainbow had admitted all of the material\n\nallegations of the complaint regarding continuing nuisance and trespass. As for\n\ncompensatory damages, the trial court concluded that no genuine issues of material\n\nfact existed regarding the calculation of damages and that as part of its damages, the\n\nAssociation was entitled to recover the $98,650 in estimated costs that were necessary\n\nto remediate the excessive stormwater runoff flowing from Rainbow\u2019s property onto\n\nthe Village\u2019s common areas.\n\n      This appeal by Rainbow followed.\n\n      1. As an initial matter, we note that the argument section of Rainbow\u2019s appellate\n\nbrief contains no record citations supporting its enumerations of error. The rules of\n\nthis Court provide that \u201c[e]ach enumerated error shall be supported in the brief by\n\nspecific reference to the record or transcript,\u201d Court of Appeals Rule 25 (d) (1) (i),\n\nand \u201ccompliance with such rules is not optional.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted.)\n\nBell v.

App. 813, 814 (856 SE2d 401) (2021).\n\n      2. Rainbow contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion to open the\n\ndefault judgment entered on the issue of liability pursuant to OCGA \u00a7 9-11-55 (b).\n\nAccording to Rainbow, it satisfied the four conditions precedent for opening a default\n\njudgment and demonstrated excusable neglect and a proper case for opening the\n\ndefault.\n\n             Under OCGA \u00a7 9-11-55 (b), at any time before final judgment, a\n      trial court has the discretion to open default on one of three grounds if\n\n                                           8\n\f      four conditions are met. The three grounds are: (1) providential cause,\n      (2) excusable neglect, and (3) proper case. The four conditions\n      precedent are: (1) a showing made under oath, (2) an offer to plead\n      instanter, (3) announcement of ready to proceed with trial, and (4)\n      setting up a meritorious defense. Compliance with the four conditions is\n      a condition precedent and once met, the question of whether to open the\n      default on one of the three grounds rests within the sound discretion of\n      the trial court.\n\n\n(Citations and punctuation omitted.)

App.\n\n904, 906-907 (4) (862 SE2d 572) (2021). \u201cAlthough the rule permitting opening of\n\ndefault is remedial in nature and should be liberally applied, and whenever possible\n\ncases should be decided on their merits as default judgment is not favored in law, this\n\nrule is not absolute.\u201d (Citation omitted.)

Id.\n\n      Even if we assume that Rainbow satisfied the four conditions precedent for\n\nopening the default judgment, we conclude that the trial court acted within its\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fdiscretion in determining that Rainbow failed to show either excusable neglect or a\n\nproper case for opening the default.4\n\n         (a) Excusable Neglect.

Bowen, 308 Ga. at 207.\n\n         In seeking to demonstrate excusable neglect, Rainbow submitted the affidavit\n\nof its manager, Uri Kaufman. Kaufman averred that Rainbow leased its property to a\n\ntenant that operated a skilled nursing and rehabilitation center; that under the terms\n\nof the lease, its tenant was required to defend and indemnify Rainbow for any and all\n\nclaims or lawsuits arising out of the operation of the property; that Rainbow \u201cnotified\n\nrepresentatives of the tenant about the lawsuit after being served and its obligation to\n\n         4\n             Rainbow did not seek to open the default based on the ground of providential\ncause.\n                                              10\n\fdefend the lawsuit on behalf of [Rainbow]\u201d; and that Rainbow was \u201cunder the\n\nimpression that the tenant would respond to the lawsuit on [its] behalf.\u201d Kaufmann\n\nfurther averred that after learning that no answer had been filed and that the\n\nAssociation had moved for summary judgment, Rainbow \u201chad [its] representatives\n\nreach out\u201d to counsel in April 2024.\n\n      In response to Rainbow\u2019s motion to open the default judgment, the Association\n\nsubmitted the affidavit of its attorney, which included several letters and emails as\n\nexhibits.5 One of the attached emails, dated July 25, 2023, was from an attorney for\n\nRainbow\u2019s tenant to the Association\u2019s attorney. Among other things, the tenant\u2019s\n\ncounsel stated in the email that he recently learned of the Association\u2019s lawsuit against\n\nRainbow and of the entry of the default judgment, and he explained that Rainbow had\n\n\u201cbecome aware of the lawsuit\u201d and was \u201choping to submit filings to open the\n\ndefault.\u201d Tenant\u2019s counsel asked that the Association agree to a stay of the litigation\n\nso that the parties could seek to \u201camicably work together towards resolving\u201d the\n\n\u201cpotential premises issues.\u201d On July 31, 2023, the Association\u2019s attorney responded\n\n      5\n       Rainbow did not object to any of the exhibits on hearsay or authentication\ngrounds or move to strike them. Accordingly, Rainbow waived any objection to their\nconsideration by the trial court. See Guise v. Leoni, 366 Ga. App. 659, 663 (a) (883\nSE2d 892) (2023).\n                                           11\n\fthat the Association would \u201cagree to pause litigation for the time being to see if we can\n\nwork things out without further time and expense.\u201d In a follow-up email dated August\n\n2, 2023, the Association\u2019s counsel clarified that the Association would not consent to\n\nopening the default but would \u201cwait on scheduling a damages hearing to see if this can\n\nbe worked out without further litigation.\u201d When efforts to resolve the matter failed,\n\nthe Association moved for summary judgment in March 2024, and Rainbow for the\n\nfirst time moved to open the default in April 2024.\n\n      Bearing this record in mind, we turn to our case law addressing excusable\n\nneglect. Although not directly on point, we have held in several cases that a defendant\n\ncan demonstrate excusable neglect by showing that he \u201cdelivered pleadings to his\n\ninsurance carrier and believed the carrier was taking the necessary steps to defend the\n\nlawsuit.\u201d Follmer v. Perry, 229 Ga. App. 257, 259 (1) (493 SE2d 631) (1997) (citing\n\ncases). See Williams v. City of Atlanta, 280 Ga. App. 785, 786-787 (635 SE2d 165)\n\n(2006); Wright v. Mann, 271 Ga. App. 832, 833 (611 SE2d 118) (2005); Pinehurst\n\nBaptist Church v. Murray, 215 Ga. App. 259, 262 (2) (450 SE2d 307) (1994). \u201cA\n\nprimary rationale for such decisions [is] that a litigant should not unnecessarily be\n\nforced into default as a consequence of having reasonably relied upon the word of his\n\n\n                                           12\n\ffellow.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted; emphasis supplied.) Follmer, 229 Ga.\n\nApp. at 259 (1). And in light of that rationale, we have explained that\n\n      a defendant\u2019s unconfirmed belief that her insurer had timely received\n      suit papers and was preparing a defense on the defendant\u2019s behalf is not\n      sufficient to constitute excusable neglect that would authorize the trial\n      court to set aside a default judgment. To authorize the setting aside of a\n      default under circumstances where the defendant believes her insurer is\n      handling the case, the defendant must demonstrate her own diligence\n      and the insurer\u2019s assurance that it is handling the case.\n\n\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.) Wright, 271 Ga. App. at 833. See Follmer, 229 Ga.\n\nApp. at 259 (1) (explaining that cases involving reliance upon an insurer \u201chave\n\nfocused on the defendant\u2019s diligence and the insurer\u2019s assurance that it is handling the\n\ncase\u201d). See also Williams, 280 Ga. App. at 786-787; Pinehurst Baptist Church, 215 Ga.\n\nApp. at 262-263 (2).\n\n      \u201cIt must be remembered that in cases such as this, no two are alike and each\n\nmust stand on its own merits. The facts in each case are different and [courts] must\n\nlook at each in the light of the facts peculiar to that particular case.\u201d (Citation and\n\npunctuation omitted.) McBee v. Benjamin, 272 Ga. App. 567, 569 (612 SE2d 802)\n\n(2005). We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court, and a trial court\n\n\n                                            13\n\fabuses its discretion by refusing to open the default only if the evidence demands a\n\nfinding of excusable neglect. See Coleman v. Superior Insurance Co., 204 Ga. App. 78,\n\n79 (418 SE2d 390) (1992).\n\n      Even if our insurance carrier cases apply by analogy to the present case, we\n\nconclude that the evidence did not demand a finding of excusable neglect. Although\n\nRainbow submitted Kaufman\u2019s affidavit in an effort to show its reasonable reliance on\n\nits tenant to defend the suit on its behalf, Kaufman did not attach any documents to\n\nhis affidavit, such as the lease agreement reflecting the tenant\u2019s alleged duty-to-defend\n\nRainbow, and he supplied no dates or details regarding Rainbow\u2019s communications\n\nwith the tenant. And while Kaufman averred that Rainbow notified its tenant about\n\nthe lawsuit and reminded it of its duty to defend, Kaufman went on to state only that\n\nRainbow was \u201cunder the impression\u201d that the tenant would handle its defense, and\n\nhe failed to describe any steps that Rainbow took to confirm whether an answer had\n\nbeen filed on its behalf.\n\n      The trial court was entitled to find that Kaufman\u2019s affidavit fell short of\n\nestablishing excusable neglect, as the affidavit was vague and indefinite at best, and\n\n\u201can affidavit containing nothing but vague assertions of fact\u201d lacks evidentiary value.\n\n\n                                           14\n\f(Citations and punctuation omitted.) D&H Constr. Co. v. City of Woodstock, 284 Ga.\n\nApp. 314, 317 (1) (643 SE2d 826) (2007). And although Kaufman averred that\n\nRainbow notified its tenant of the lawsuit, he did not point to any assurances that\n\nRainbow received from the tenant that it was proceeding with the defense, and our\n\ncase law establishes that \u201cmerely assuming that a complaint is being handled by [a\n\nthird party] is insufficient to establish excusable neglect as a matter of law.\u201d BellSouth\n\nTelecommunications v. Future Communications, 293 Ga. App. 247, 249 (1) (666 SE2d\n\n699) (2008), disapproved in part on other grounds by Bowen, 308 Ga. at 209, n. 7. See\n\nWright, 271 Ga. App. at 833 (concluding defendant failed to show excusable neglect,\n\nwhere the defendant \u201cassumed that a defense was being provided for her\u201d)\n\n(punctuation omitted); Follmer, 229 Ga. App. at 259 (1) (determining that defendant\n\nfailed to establish excusable neglect, where the defendant \u201cbelieved the insurance\n\ncarrier had hired an attorney and that the case was being handled appropriately,\u201d but\n\nprovided no evidence that he acted with diligence or received assurances that the\n\ninsurer was proceeding with a defense). Indeed, we have previously held in a case\n\nwhere a defendant requested a defense and indemnification under a lease agreement\n\nthat the trial court was authorized to find that merely being \u201cleft with the impression\u201d\n\n\n                                            15\n\fthat a defense would be provided was insufficient to show excusable neglect. See\n\nHowell Enterprises v. Ray, 163 Ga. App. 68, 69 (293 SE2d 24) (1982). Accordingly, the\n\ntrial court committed no error in finding that Kaufman\u2019s affidavit failed to establish\n\nexcusable neglect by Rainbow. See Williams, 280 Ga. App. at 786-787; Wright, 271 Ga.\n\nApp. at 833; Follmer, 229 Ga. App. at 259-260 (1).\n\n      The trial court\u2019s finding also was supported by the affidavit of the Association\u2019s\n\nattorney and the emails attached thereto. The emails from the attorney for Rainbow\u2019s\n\ntenant do not reflect any assurances by the tenant to file an answer or other pleadings\n\non behalf of Rainbow; at most, they reflect that the tenant assisted with settlement\n\nnegotiations between the parties after the default already had occurred. Moreover, the\n\nemails show that Rainbow was aware of the default in July 2023 and expressed to\n\ntenant\u2019s counsel that it planned to \u201csubmit filings\u201d to open the default. Nevertheless,\n\nRainbow delayed until April 2024 to file a motion to open the default, even after the\n\nAssociation indicated by email in August 2023 that it would not consent to an opening\n\nof the default as part of any settlement negotiations. It is well-established that \u201cany\n\nadditional delay occasioned by a failure to file promptly for opening default upon its\n\ndiscovery can be considered in determining whether defendants\u2019 neglect was\n\n\n                                          16\n\fexcusable.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Ford v. Saint Francis Hosp., 227 Ga.\n\nApp. 823, 826 (1) (490 SE2d 415) (1997). In light of the approximately nine-month\n\ndelay in seeking to open default, the trial court was entitled to find that Rainbow did\n\nnot act promptly to open the default and to conclude that Rainbow failed to show\n\nexcusable neglect for this additional reason. See id.6\n\n      In sum, \u201c[w]e hold that [the] facts and circumstances [of this case] do not\n\ndemand a finding of excusable neglect, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby refusing to open the default\u201d on that ground. Coleman, 204 Ga. App. at 79.\n\n      (b) Proper Case. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in rejecting\n\nRainbow\u2019s assertion that it showed a proper case for opening default.\n\n      The proper case ground for opening default has been construed to confer\n      discretion on the trial court broader than that conferred on the other two\n      grounds, as if reaching out to take in every conceivable case where\n      injustice might result if the default were not opened, although the\n      defendant\u2019s failure to file a timely answer must not have resulted from\n      wilful or gross negligence. This is an intensely fact-specific inquiry. It\n\n\n      6\n        Citing Rose Printing Co. v. EOS Group, 155 Ga. App. 743, 744 (272 SE2d 585)\n(1980), Rainbow argues that an \u201cunderstandable misunderstanding between the\nparties\u201d is an appropriate ground to open default based on excusable neglect. But Rose\nPrinting Co. is inapposite because there is no evidence of any misunderstanding\nbetween the two parties, the Association and Rainbow.\n                                          17\n\f      includes consideration of whether the defaulting party acted promptly to\n      open the default upon learning no answer had been either filed or timely\n      filed.\n\n\n(Citation and punctuation omitted.)

As noted supra\n\nin Division 2 (a), the evidence reflected that Rainbow delayed until April 2024 to seek\n\nto open the default, although it had known for approximately nine months that its\n\n                                           18\n\ftenant had failed to file an answer on its behalf and that a default judgment had been\n\nentered. Additionally, the Association presented evidence that it had already incurred\n\n$16,261 in engineering fees to design a stormwater remediation plan to permanently\n\naddress the excessive runoff flowing from Rainbow\u2019s property, which could be\n\nimplemented once the litigation was resolved in its favor. The Association explained,\n\nhowever, that if the default were opened, causing further delay in resolution of the\n\ncase, implementation of the remediation plan would be put off even longer, causing\n\nthe Association to \u201ccontinue to incur expenses cleaning silt and sediment from its\n\nproperty following each rain event\u201d and rendering its current estimated costs of\n\nremediation \u201cstale.\u201d\n\n      In light of this record, the trial court acted within its discretion in concluding\n\nthat this was not a proper case for opening the default. See Cruz, 374 Ga. App. at 414\n\n(3) (noting that trial court may take into account harm or prejudice to the plaintiff as\n\npart of the proper case analysis); Troika Entertainment, 360 Ga.

This argument fails because\nthe trial court committed no error in declining to open the default, as discussed supra\nin Division 2.\n                                           20\n\f      OCGA \u00a7 9-11-56 (c).

Rainbow argues that the trial court erred in awarding\n\nthose damages because the Association failed to prove them with reasonable certainty\n\nusing competent evidence.\n\n       To support its claim for estimated remediation costs, the Association submitted\n\nthe affidavit of Jeff Carter, a licensed professional engineer who has primarily worked\n\nin the field of civil engineering for the past 25 years. Carter averred that he has regular\n\nexperience \u201cconsult[ing] in the design and construction of grading plans/earthwork\n\nanalysis, erosion and sediment control plans, and stormwater management planning.\u201d\n\nCarter and his engineering firm prepared the \u201cSite Development Plans for Red Oak\n\nVillage\u201d (\u201cDevelopment Plans\u201d), which were attached as an exhibit to his affidavit\n\nand included detailed diagrams and schematics of the proposed remediation work.\n\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f      Carter also averred that a landscaping firm \u2014 Conner Grading & Landscaping\n\n\u2014 had prepared an estimate of $98,650 to implement the Development Plans\n\n(\u201cLandscaping Estimate\u201d), which was attached as an exhibit to his affidavit. Carter\n\nstated that he had reviewed the Landscaping Estimate, and that\n\n      based on [his] experience in the field of civil engineering and specifically\n      [his] experience with other projects requiring grading and earthwork,\n      erosion and sediment control, and stormwater remediation, Conner\u2019s\n      estimated cost of $98,650.00 is both reasonable and necessary to\n      implement the . . . Development Plans in order to remediate and prevent\n      the flow of the excessive stormwater runoff that currently flows from\n      [Rainbow\u2019s] Property to [the] Village.\u201d\n\n\n      In addition to Carter\u2019s affidavit, the Association submitted the affidavit of Les\n\nMcCrary, the principal and owner of the management company for the Association.\n\nThe Landscaping Estimate was attached as one of the exhibits to the affidavit of\n\nMcCrary, who averred that he had personal knowledge of the method in which the\n\nAssociation maintained its business records and sought to lay a foundation for\n\nadmission of the Landscaping Estimate as a document incorporated into and\n\nmaintained as a business record of the Association.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f      In arguing that the Association failed to prove $98,650 in estimated remediation\n\ncosts to a degree of reasonable certainty, Rainbow contends that (i) the Landscaping\n\nEstimate constituted inadmissible hearsay and (ii) Carter failed to lay a sufficient\n\nfoundation for his expert opinion that the Landscaping Estimate was reasonable and\n\nnecessary to implement the Development Plans.\n\n      \u201cThe admissibility of evidence on motion for summary judgment is governed\n\nby the rules relating to form and admissibility of evidence generally.

But as noted\n\nabove, in moving for summary judgment, the Association also submitted the affidavit\n\nof McCrary, who sought to lay a foundation for admission of the Landscaping\n\nEstimate as an integrated business record of the Association.

We disagree. Carter worked in the field of civil\n\nengineering for over 25 years and had experience in \u201cconsult[ing] in the design and\n\nconstruction of grading plans/earthwork analysis, erosion and sediment control plans,\n\nand stormwater management planning.\u201d According to his affidavit, Carter and his\n\nfirm created the Development Plans, he personally reviewed the Landscaping\n\nEstimate, and his opinions related to the Landscaping Estimate were \u201cbased on [his]\n\nexperience in the field of civil engineering and specifically [his] experience with other\n\nprojects requiring grading and earthwork, erosion and sediment control, and\n\nstormwater remediation.\u201d\n\n      \u201cThe question of whether a witness is qualified to render an opinion as an\n\nexpert is a legal determination for the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation and punctuation omitted.) Ga. Dept. of\n\nTransp. v. Owens, 330 Ga. App. 123, 127 (1) (766 SE2d 569) (2014). In light of Carter\u2019s\n\n\n                                           27\n\fcredentials and experience, the trial court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in\n\nfind that Carter was qualified to render opinions regarding the Landscaping Estimate\n\nand implementation of the Development Plans. See id. at 127-128 (1) (a) (concluding\n\nthat trial court acted within its discretion in concluding that industrial and mechanical\n\nengineer was entitled to offer expert opinion based on his \u201cconsiderable credentials\n\nwith respect to the research, study and application of [the pertinent type of]\n\nengineering\u201d).

Therefore, the burden shifted to Rainbow to come forward with rebuttal\n\nevidence to avoid the grant of summary judgment to the Association on the issue of\n\ndamages. See Wilson v. Inthachak, 372 Ga. App. 341, 342 (904 SE2d 414) (2024)\n\n(\u201cOnce the movant has made a prima facie showing that he is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law [on summary judgment], the burden shifts to the respondent to come\n\nforward with rebuttal evidence.\u201d) (citation and punctuation omitted).\n\n      (b) Rainbow contends that it presented rebuttal evidence on the issue of\n\ndamages such that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the\n\nAssociation. Specifically, in opposing summary judgment, Rainbow submitted the\n\naffidavits of its tenant\u2019s former and current maintenance directors, and Rainbow\n\nargues that the affidavits created a genuine issue of material fact as to damages.\n\n      In granting summary judgment to the Association, the trial court did not\n\nconsider the aforementioned affidavits, and we discern no error by the trial court in\n\nlight of the default judgment that was entered in the case. The tenant\u2019s former\n\n\n                                          30\n\fmaintenance director averred that he was unaware of any stormwater runoff flowing\n\nfrom Rainbow\u2019s property to the Association\u2019s property and that any problems with\n\nrunoff arose only after the developer of the Village removed trees and graded the\n\nproperty for townhouses. The current maintenance director averred that the tenant\n\nconstructed a 75-foot trench and installed a pool liner and drainage gravel that\n\ndiverted stormwater runoff away from the Association\u2019s property, and that since that\n\ntime, the tenant had not been notified of any other runoff issues.\n\n      \u201cAs set forth above, defendant in default is in the position of having admitted\n\neach and every material allegation of the plaintiff\u2019s petition except as to the amount\n\nof damages alleged.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The following factual allegations drawn from Mr. Shih\u2019s complaint, ECF No. 1, are\n\naccepted as true for the purpose of evaluating the motion before the court, Jerome Stevens Pharms.,\n\nInc. v. Food & Drug Admin., 402 F.3d 1249, 1250 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n       Mr. Shih is a \u201cminority business owner\u201d who identifies as an \u201cAsian-American and [a]\n\nChristian.\u201d ECF No. 1 \u00b6 4. Mr. Shih applied to two CDFIs\u2014the Greater Newark Enterprise\n\nCorporation (\u201cGNEC\u201d) and the Union County Economic Development Corporation\n\n(\u201cUCEDC\u201d)\u2014seeking funds for his business. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 11-14. \u201c[D]espite [his] robust FICO\n\nscore\u201d and \u201cbusiness serving the Newark, NJ area,\u201d id. \u00b6 11, both organizations declined to loan\n\nMr. Shih monies from the CDFI Fund, id. \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.\n\n       In August 2023, Mr. Shih sent an email to the CDFI Fund \u201cexpressing dissatisfaction with\n\nthe difficulties encountered in obtaining financial assistance\u201d from GNEC and UCEDC. Id. \u00b6 7.\n\nSpecifically, he wrote that his \u201cexperience this year and last year is [that] it is harder to approach\n\nCDFI than regular loaners\u201d and that \u201c[t]he people with CDFI money to give don\u2019t seem to care\n\nabout the community and making their country better. They seem to want to make companies\n\njump through hoops and seem judgemental [sic] and not helpful at all, or even discriminatory.\u201d\n\nECF No. 15-1 (Mr. Shih\u2019s initial letter to the CDFI Fund); see Banneker Ventures, LLC v. Graham,\n\n798 F.3d 1119, 1133 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\u201cA district court may consider a document that a complaint\n\nspecifically references without converting the motion into one for summary judgment.\u201d). Mr. Shih\n\nalleges that the CDFI Fund responded the following day by \u201cacknowledging [his] concerns and\n\nrequesting additional documentation of specific encounters with CDFI-approved organizations.\u201d\n\nECF No. 1 \u00b6 8. He maintains that he \u201cprovided details regarding interactions with GNEC and\n\nUCEDC,\u201d id. \u00b6 9, and that the CDFI Fund \u201cassured [him] that a representative would contact [him]\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fwithin two business days,\u201d id. \u00b6 10. \u201cDespite CDFI\u2019s initial acknowledgement and assurance of a\n\nprompt response,\u201d Mr. Shih did not \u201creceive[] any communication for three months.\u201d Id. \u00b6 15. In\n\nSeptember 2023, Mr. Shih \u201cemphasized [his] protected status as an Asian American and believer\n\n[in] Jesus Christ The Lord,\u201d and he alleges that the CDFI Fund\u2019s \u201clack of response may be linked\n\nto discrimination based on these factors.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16.\n\n\n                              III.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       In May 2024, Mr. Shih brought this case against the CDFI Fund and the Treasury\n\nDepartment seeking declaratory, compensatory, and injunctive relief. ECF No. 1, at 16. In\n\nCount I, Mr. Shih contends that the CDFI Fund\u2019s administration of its program violates Title VI\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d et seq., and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. ECF No. 1\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 22-27. In Count II, he alleges that the CDFI Fund negligently breached its duty of \u201censuring\n\nfair and non-discriminatory practices\u201d when processing his loan application(s). Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. In\n\nCount III, Mr. Shih asserts that the CDFI Fund violated Title VI by discriminating against him.\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 30-36. And in Count IV, he claims that the CDFI Fund\u2019s \u201cprolonged silence and inaction\n\nfollowing [his] expression of concerns surrounding the discriminatory application process\u201d\n\nconstitutes retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n\net seq. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 37-43.\n\n       In January 2025, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nECF No. 10, at 1. Mr. Shih quickly filed an opposition. ECF No. 11. Because Mr. Shih filed his\n\nopposition before the court had an opportunity to advise him of his obligations under Fox v.\n\nStrickland, 837 F.2d 507, 509 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court issued a Fox/Neal order and allowed him\n\nto file a supplemental opposition brief. ECF No. 12. Mr. Shih filed his supplemental opposition\n\n                                                 4\n\fin February 2025, ECF No. 13, and Defendants filed a reply in March 2025, ECF No. 15. The\n\nmotion to dismiss is now ripe for disposition. ECF Nos. 10, 11, 13, 15.\n\n\n                                  IV.     LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       \u201cFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\u201d and it is generally presumed that \u201ca cause\n\nlies outside [of] this limited jurisdiction.\u201d Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S.\n\n375, 377 (1994). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the court must dismiss an action\n\nunless the plaintiff can establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the court possesses\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. Green v. Stuyvesant, 505 F. Supp. 2d 176, 178 (D.D.C. 2007). In\n\nreviewing such a motion, the court \u201cis not limited to the allegations set forth in the complaint\u201d and\n\n\u201cmay consider materials outside the pleadings.\u201d Morrow v. United States, 723 F. Supp. 2d 71, 76\n\n(D.D.C. 2010) (quoting Jerome Stevens Pharms., 402 F.3d at 1253). Additionally, when reviewing\n\na motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the court is required to \u201cassume the truth of all\n\nmaterial factual allegations in the complaint and \u2018construe the complaint liberally, granting\n\nplaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.\u2019\u201d Am. Nat\u2019l Ins.\n\nCo. v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Thomas v. Principi,\n\n394 F.3d 970, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).\n\n       Under Rule 12(b)(6), the court will dismiss a complaint that does not \u201ccontain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d Ashcroft\n\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).\n\n\u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to\n\ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d Id. In\n\nevaluating a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), a court accepts all well-pleaded factual allegations in the\n\ncomplaint as true. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007); see also Atherton v. D.C. Off.\n\n                                                  5\n\fof the Mayor, 567 F.3d 672, 681 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Although the plausibility standard does not\n\nrequire \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d it \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic\n\nrecitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Nor will\n\n\u201c\u2018naked assertion[s]\u2019 devoid of \u2018further factual enhancement\u2019\u201d suffice. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).\n\n       Complaints filed by pro se litigants are generally held \u201cto less stringent standards than\n\nformal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972) (per curiam).\n\nThis liberal construction for pro se plaintiffs \u201cis not, however, a license to ignore the Federal Rules\n\nof Civil Procedure.\u201d Sturdza v. United Arab Emirates, 658 F. Supp. 2d 135, 137 (D.D.C. 2009).\n\nThus, \u201ceven a pro se plaintiff must meet his burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction to survive\n\na Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.\u201d Smith v. Scalia, 44 F. Supp. 3d 28, 36 (D.D.C. 2014).\n\n\n                                       V.      DISCUSSION\n\n       As a threshold matter, it is important to understand who this case is against and what it is\n\nabout. In his complaint, Mr. Shih largely alleges discrimination against him by GNEC and\n\nUCEDC. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12 (GNEC), \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 (UCEDC), \u00b6 17 (alleging that \u201cthe actions and\n\ninaction of CDFI, GNEC, and UCEDC amount to discrimination, negligence, and a failure to\n\nadhere to CDFI\u2019s mission of promoting economic opportunity for underserved communities\u201d).\n\nBut Mr. Shih does not name GNEC and UCEDC as Defendants in his complaint, id. \u00b6 5, and while\n\nthese organizations are certified to loan money from the CDFI Fund, they are not part of the federal\n\ngovernment, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 18005.201(b)(6). Accordingly, Mr. Shih\u2019s suit is best understood as a\n\nsuit against the CDFI Fund and Treasury Department for (1) failing to prevent discrimination in\n\nthe administration of the CDFI Fund\u2019s program (Counts I-III); and (2) failing to respond to his\n\ncomplaints about GNEC and UCEDC (Count IV). With that in mind, the court turns to the counts\n\n                                                  6\n\fin Mr. Shih\u2019s complaint and concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Counts I-III\n\nand that Mr. Shih has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on Count IV.\n\n\n                        A.      Subject-Matter Jurisdiction (Counts I-III)\n\n        The court begins, as it must, with subject-matter jurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\n\nBetter Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 93-94 (1998); see Schmidt v. U.S. Capitol Police Bd., 826 F. Supp. 2d\n\n59, 64 (D.D.C. 2011) (explaining that when a defendant files a motion to dismiss pursuant to both\n\nRule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6), \u201cthe court must first examine the Rule 12(b)(1) challenge[]\u201d\n\nbecause a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction renders all other defenses and objections moot). The\n\ncourt concludes that the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity for Mr. Shih\u2019s claim\n\nfor monetary relief as it pertains to Counts I-III, that he lacks standing to pursue a claim for\n\ninjunctive relief, and that he is not entitled to declaratory relief.\n\n\n                                       1.       Monetary relief\n\n        As a general matter, \u201cthe United States cannot be sued without its consent.\u201d Settles v. U.S.\n\nParole Comm\u2019n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Congress may waive the United States\u2019\n\nsovereign immunity for certain claims, but such waiver \u201cmust be unequivocally expressed.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980) (quoting United States v. King, 395 U.S. 1, 4 (1969)).\n\nBefore a plaintiff can sue the United States, he \u201cbears the burden of establishing that sovereign\n\nimmunity has been abrogated.\u201d Stone v. Holder, 859 F. Supp. 2d 48, 51 (D.D.C. 2012). If he fails\n\nto do so, he cannot \u201cestablish the jurisdiction necessary to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to\n\ndismiss.\u201d Jackson v. Bush, 448 F. Supp. 2d 198, 200 (D.D.C. 2006).\n\n        While Mr. Shih does not tie any specific request for relief to any particular count in his\n\ncomplaint, he seeks \u201c[a]n award of compensatory damages to remedy the tangible and intangible\n\n\n\n                                                    7\n\fharms suffered by [him].\u201d ECF No. 1, at 16. Defendants argue that the United States has not\n\nwaived its sovereign immunity to be sued for money damages for some of Mr. Shih\u2019s claims and\n\nthat Mr. Shih has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the FTCA as it applies to\n\nothers. The court agrees.\n\n\n                                          a.     Count I\n\n       In Count I, Mr. Shih appears to invoke Title VI, Section 1983, and Bivens v. Six Unknown\n\nNamed Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), as bases on which he can\n\nseek monetary relief. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 22-27. The court addresses each in turn.\n\n       Title VI. Title VI provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of\n\nrace, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. \u201cGenerally, private plaintiffs may only use Title VI \u2018to sue a discriminatory\n\nfund recipient to terminate the offending discrimination[]\u2019; they may not sue \u2018the enforcing\n\nagency.\u2019\u201d Kanam v. Off. of the Sec\u2019y of Educ., No. 20-CV-123, 2020 WL 3832916, at *3 (D.D.C.\n\nJuly 8, 2020) (quoting Wash. Legal Found. v. Alexander, 778 F. Supp. 67, 69 (D.D.C. 1991)).5\n\nWhile Mr. Shih argues that the CDFI Fund is \u201ca recipient of federal funds,\u201d it is not. ECF No. 1\n\n\u00b6 30. Instead, the CDFI Fund is an agency within the Treasury Department that disburses federal\n\nfunds to CDFIs like GNEC and UCEDC. See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4701 et seq. Consequently, while\n\nMr. Shih might have a Title VI claim against GNEC or UCEDC, the United States has not waived\n\n\n\n5\n  \u201cA plaintiff may in rare cases sue a funding agency under Title VI where the agency has\n\u2018consciously and expressly adopted a policy [abdicating] its statutory duty\u2019 by continuing to fund\ndiscriminatory educational institutions.\u201d Kanam, 2020 WL 3832916, at *3 n.4 (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Adams v. Richardson, 480 F.2d 1159, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1973)). Mr. Shih\u2019s\nallegations, even generously construed, do not rise to this level.\n\n                                                 8\n\fits sovereign immunity to permit a Title VI claim against the CDFI Fund or the Treasury\n\nDepartment.6\n\n       Section 1983. Mr. Shih also purports to bring Count I under Section 1983. ECF No. 1\n\n\u00b6 27. That statute provides a civil cause of action against \u201c[e]very person\u201d who, while acting\n\n\u201cunder color of [state law],\u201d deprives an individual of their constitutional rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983;\n\nSettles, 429 F.3d at 1104. As a general rule, however, the statute \u201cdoes not apply to federal actors.\u201d\n\nMullen v. Bureau of Prisons, 843 F. Supp. 2d 112, 116 (D.D.C. 2012). The determinative\n\nconsideration is whether the defendant was acting under the color of state law when he violated the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s rights. See Williams v. United States, 396 F.3d 412, 413-16 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Here, it\n\nis evident that the \u201cstate law\u201d component is missing, as Mr. Shih is suing two federal defendants\n\nfor their actions in overseeing the federal CDFI Fund program. Accordingly, the United States\n\nhas not waived its sovereign immunity for a claim under Section 1983 as it pertains to Mr. Shih\u2019s\n\nallegations.\n\n       Bivens. In his supplemental opposition, Mr. Shih invokes Bivens as a basis under which\n\nhe can seek monetary relief against Defendants. ECF No. 13, at 1-2. The problem with this\n\nargument is that the Bivens remedy, in the limited circumstances where it is available, see\n\nHern\u00e1ndez v. Mesa, 589 U.S. 93, 102 (2020), is only available against an individual federal officer\n\nor employee. Here, Mr. Shih has sued the Treasury Department and the CDFI Fund, one of the\n\nTreasury Department\u2019s component agencies, and the Supreme Court has soundly rejected the\n\nnotion that Bivens should be extended to federal agencies as opposed to individuals. Fed. Deposit\n\n\n\n\n6\n  While Defendants do not press this argument and instead seek dismissal of Mr. Shih\u2019s Title VI\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6), ECF No. 10, at 8-9, this court has an independent obligation to consider\nits own jurisdiction, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006).\n\n                                                  9\n\fIns. Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 486 (1994) (\u201cAn extension of Bivens to agencies of the Federal\n\nGovernment is not supported by the logic of Bivens itself.\u201d). Bivens thus fails to provide a basis\n\nfor this court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\n                                          b.      Count II\n\n        In Count II, Mr. Shih invokes the FTCA, which provides \u201ca limited waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity that makes the federal government liable . . . for certain torts of federal employees acting\n\nwithin the scope of their employment.\u201d Johnson v. Veterans Affs. Med. Ctr., 133 F. Supp. 3d 10,\n\n14-15 (D.D.C. 2015).7 In order to sue under the FTCA, however, a plaintiff must first exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies by presenting the relevant agency with \u201c(1) a written statement\n\nsufficiently describing the injury to enable the agency to begin its own investigation, and (2) a\n\nsum-certain damages claim.\u201d GAF Corp. v. United States, 818 F.2d 901, 919 (D.C. Cir. 1987);\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). \u201cIf a plaintiff fails to properly exhaust his remedies, the Court lacks\n\njurisdiction over his subsequent tort claims.\u201d Wiggins v. Brennan, 308 F. Supp. 3d 274, 276\n\n(D.D.C. 2018).\n\n        In moving to dismiss, Defendants argue that Mr. Shih\u2019s August 2023 email to the CDFI\n\nFund was insufficient to exhaust his administrative remedies because Mr. Shih did not allege\n\ndiscrimination or seek a sum certain. ECF No. 10, at 7-8. In response, Mr. Shih asserts that his\n\nemail constituted \u201csubstantial compliance with exhaustion requirements\u201d under the FTCA. ECF\n\nNo. 11, at 2. The court agrees with Defendants.\n\n\n\n7\n  In FTCA cases like this one, the United States is the only proper defendant. See, e.g., Hall v.\nAdmin. Off. of the U.S. Courts, 496 F. Supp. 2d 203, 206 (D.D.C. 2007). While Mr. Shih named\nthe CDFI Fund and the Treasury Department, not the United States, ECF No. 1 \u00b6 5, in light of his\npro se status, the court will \u201ctreat[] [his] claim as if it had been brought against the United States\ndirectly,\u201d Chandler v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 226 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 n.3 (D.D.C. 2016).\n\n                                                 10\n\f       To begin, Mr. Shih\u2019s initial email was not sufficient to put Defendants on notice of any\n\nclaim against them. See GAF Corp., 818 F.2d at 919. Instead, Mr. Shih complains of his \u201cpoor\n\nexperience relating\u201d to his attempts to receive funds from two CDFI-certified organizations, which\n\nhe believes \u201cgo[es] against the mission of [the] CDFI [program].\u201d ECF No. 15-1. While Mr. Shih\n\nat one point suggests that \u201c[t]he people with CDFI money . . . seem judgemental [sic] and not\n\nhelpful at all, or even discriminatory,\u201d id., he does not provide any detail suggesting that federal\n\nactors, as opposed to GNEC and UCEDC, mistreated him, see 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 18005.201(b)(6)\n\n(explaining that a CDFI like GNEC and UCEDC cannot be an \u201cagency or instrumentality of the\n\nUnited States, or any State or political subdivision thereof\u201d). And while Mr. Shih now complains\n\nthat the CDFI Fund discriminated against him by not timely responding to his claims, ECF No. 1\n\n\u00b6\u00b6 16-17, he nowhere suggests that he put Defendants on notice of that claim, see generally id.\n\nEven if Mr. Shih had, he failed to request a sum certain, which is a separate basis on which to\n\nconclude that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies. GAF Corp., 818 F.2d at 919\n\n(\u201cSection 2675(a) requires a claimant to file . . . a sum-certain damages claim.\u201d). Accordingly,\n\nMr. Shih cannot show that he exhausted his administrative remedies and therefore cannot avail\n\nhimself of the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity as it pertains to Count II.\n\n\n                                         c.      Count III\n\n       Mr. Shih relies on Title VI as the sole basis for Count III. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 30-36; ECF\n\nNo. 11, at 2. As explained above, the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity to\n\npermit a Title VI claim against the CDFI Fund or the Treasury Department.                See supra\n\nPart V.A.1.a.\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f                                     2.      Injunctive relief\n\n       In addition to monetary compensation, Mr. Shih seeks \u201c[i]njunctive relief mandating CDFI\n\nto reassess [his] application in a non-discriminatory manner and to implement corrective measures\n\nto prevent future discrimination.\u201d ECF No. 1, at 16. The United States has waived its sovereign\n\nimmunity for injunctive and declaratory relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 702, but in order to invoke this court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction, Mr. Shih must have standing\n\nto bring this claim. To satisfy the constitutional requirement for standing, a plaintiff must have:\n\n\u201c(1) an \u2018injury in fact\u2019 that is \u2018concrete and particularized\u2019 as well as \u2018actual or imminent\u2019; (2) a\n\n\u2018causal connection\u2019 between the injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) a likelihood, as\n\nopposed to mere speculation, \u2018that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019\u201d Ark\n\nInitiative v. Tidwell, 749 F.3d 1071, 1075 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504\n\nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992)). Mr. Shih has sufficiently alleged an injury in fact\u2014he did not receive\n\nthe loans he wanted\u2014but he fails at the second and third steps. Specifically, at no point in his\n\ncomplaint does he allege that Defendants, the CDFI Fund and the Treasury Department, denied\n\nhis loan applications. To the contrary, he places that blame squarely on GNEC and UCEDC, ECF\n\nNo. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-14, who are not parties to this suit. And because Defendants were not responsible for\n\nassessing his loan applications, no relief from this court would redress his injury. See Citizens\n\nAlert Regarding the Env\u2019t v. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency, 259 F. Supp. 2d 9, 17 n.7 (D.D.C. 2003).8\n\n\n\n\n8\n  As for Mr. Shih\u2019s request for \u201ccorrective measures,\u201d ECF No. 1, at 16, he can make such a request\nthrough the Treasury\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and Equal Employment Opportunity. 31 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 22.7; see U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Civil Rights and Equal Employment\nOpportunity, https://perma.cc/S9FM-FACT.\n\n                                                 12\n\f                                    3.        Declaratory relief\n\n       Mr. Shih also seeks \u201c[a] declaration from the Court affirming CDFI\u2019s violation of the Civil\n\nRights Act, negligence, and breach of duty to promote economic opportunity.\u201d ECF No. 1, at 16.\n\nBut where, as here, the court has found that the plaintiff has \u201cnot alleged a cognizable cause of\n\naction,\u201d it has \u201cno basis upon which to [award] declaratory relief.\u201d Ali v. Rumsfeld, 649 F.3d 762,\n\n778 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining that \u201cthe availability of [declaratory] relief presupposes the\n\nexistence of a judicially remediable right\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting C & E Servs., Inc. of\n\nWash. v. D.C. Water & Sewer Auth., 310 F.3d 197, 201 (D.C. Cir. 2002))).\n\n                                          *       *      *\n\n       Accordingly, the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over Mr. Shih\u2019s claims in\n\nCounts I-III.\n\n\n                                    B.        Merits (Count IV)\n\n       Turning to the merits, Mr. Shih argues in Count IV that \u201cCDFI\u2019s prolonged silence and\n\ninaction following the plaintiff\u2019s expression of concerns surrounding the discriminatory application\n\nprocess constitute retaliation for protected activity under [Title VII].\u201d ECF No. 1 \u00b6 38. Defendants\n\ndo not dispute that the United States has waived its sovereign immunity for claims of retaliation\n\nunder Title VII\u2014nor could it. See Rochon v. Gonzales, 438 F.3d 1121, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2006).\n\nInstead, Defendants argue that Mr. Shih has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6). ECF No. 10, at 9. Again, the court agrees with Defendants.\n\n       Title VII prohibits employers from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to\n\nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s\n\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). The trouble for Mr. Shih,\n\nhowever, is that he may only bring such a claim \u201cagainst his . . . employer.\u201d Young v. Sullivan,\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f733 F. Supp. 131, 132 (D.D.C. 1990). Mr. Shih nowhere alleges that he was employed by\n\nDefendants; to the contrary, he alleges that he is \u201cthe founder and owner of The Set International\n\nLLC,\u201d which is \u201ca minority-owned small business dedicated to serving the interests of Newark NJ\n\namong other areas.\u201d ECF No. 1 \u00b6 18. In the absence of an employment relationship, Mr. Shih has\n\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Title VII.\n\n\n                                     VI.     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the court will grant Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, ECF No. 10,\n\nand dismiss Counts I-III without prejudice and Count IV with prejudice. A contemporaneous\n\norder will issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     LOREN L.

For the following reasons,\nthe Court orders Pulaski to authorize the surgery and pay additional temporary disability\nbenefits.\n\n                                    History of Claim\n\n       Mr. Brown suffered a work injury on February 1, 2023, when a bucket from a boom\ntruck struck him on the head as it was lowered to the ground. He immediately went to the\nemergency room, where he reported neck, back, and right-shoulder pain but no weakness\nor numbness. Multiple CT scans did not reveal any acute abnormalities.\n\n        When Mr. Brown\u2019s pain did not improve with conservative treatment, Pulaski\nauthorized him to see board-certified orthopedic spine specialist Dr. Qamirani. At his first\nvisit in March, Mr. Brown complained of \u201c9 out of 10 level\u201d stabbing pain on the right side\nof his neck that radiated to the top of both shoulders and down the thoracic spine as well\nas occasional numbness in his right shoulder and hand.\n\n       Dr. Qamirani diagnosed a cervical sprain and ordered a cervical MRI, which\noccurred in April. According to the radiologist, the MRI revealed \u201coverall mild\ndegenerative changes resulting in mild bilateral foraminal stenosis C3-C4. No central\n\n                                             1\n\fprotruded disc or central canal stenosis.\u201d However, Dr. Qamirani disagreed with this\ninterpretation. He described the MRI as revealing a \u201cC3-4 bulging disc with severe right\nand moderate left foraminal stenosis.\u201d\n\n       Dr. Qamirani treated Mr. Brown with steroid injections, but he still experienced \u201c8\nout of 10\u201d pain in his neck and shoulders with occasional numbness in his right upper\nextremity. He also complained of frequent migraines. Dr. Qamirani ordered additional\nphysical therapy but noted that a cervical fusion might be necessary if Mr. Brown did not\nsignificantly improve.\n\n       Mr. Brown still had not improved by his next visit in August. In addition to his\nother complaints, he reported numbness in his left arm and fingers. Based on the lack of\nimprovement and the severity of symptoms, Dr. Qamirani recommended a C3-C4 disc\nfusion. He cautioned that he would discharge Mr. Brown from treatment if Pulaski denied\nthe surgery.\n\n        Pulaski sent the surgery recommendation through utilization review to a board-\ncertified orthopedist, Dr. Sean Lager. Dr. Lager said that Dr. Qamirani\u2019s MRI review was\ninconsistent with the radiologist\u2019s, and Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms were not in line with\nobjective tests. He also said that no neurological deficits were present at the C3-4 level.\nDr. Lager further noted that Mr. Brown smoked, which led to unsuccessful fusions. Thus,\nhe denied the surgery.\n\n       Mr. Brown appealed the decision to the Bureau\u2019s medical directors. Dr. Robert\nSnyder and Dr. James Talmage, both orthopedists, agreed with Dr. Lager. The denial letter\nsaid that the procedure was not medically necessary.\n\n        Dr. Qamirani discharged Mr. Brown, and Pulaski authorized Dr. Robert Clendenin,\nphysical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, to see him in October. Mr. Brown told Dr.\nClendenin that he suffered a new onset of pain in July or August, so that it now radiated\ninto the left arm as well as the right. Dr. Clendenin ordered a second cervical MRI and\nbilateral upper extremity EMGs.\n\n       At the next visit, Dr. Clendenin noted the MRI revealed severe right foraminal\nstenosis and moderate to severe left stenosis due to spondylosis at C3-4 that impinged upon\nthe exiting right nerve roots. The EMGs showed evidence of mild cubital tunnel syndrome\non the right. However, Dr. Clendenin did not see any evidence of a disc herniation or acute\nradiculopathy. He said he could not verify any of Mr. Brown\u2019s pain complaints or see any\nabnormality he could attribute to the work injury. He placed Mr. Brown at maximum\nmedical improvement and referred him to pain management for possible cervical nerve\nblocks and medication management.\n\n       Pulaski then transferred Mr. Brown\u2019s care to physiatrist Kenneth Sykes, M.D. At\n\n                                            2\n\fthe first visit in January 2024, Mr. Brown complained of bilateral neck pain that radiated\nto both arms as well as numbness and tingling in both arms, the left being worse than the\nright. Dr. Sykes performed a nerve block at C3-C4 that provided a few hours\u2019 relief. He\nordered a right-shoulder MRI that showed moderate AC joint degeneration but no rotator\ncuff tear.\n\n      Dr. Sykes then performed an ablation at C3-4, which gave some pain relief. But\nMr. Brown continued to experience significant symptoms, so Dr Sykes recommended he\nundergo a third cervical MRI in June.\n\n       According to this MRI report, Mr. Brown suffered from mild to moderate disc\nbulges with mild to moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis at C3-4, C4-5, and C6-7. Dr.\nSykes said he did not have any further treatment options. However, he did note that Mr.\nBrown had successfully completed a smoking cessation program. On July 15, he placed\nMr. Brown at maximum medical improvement with a 4% impairment and said he did not\nanticipate any further treatment for Mr. Brown\u2019s neck.\n\n       However, Mr. Brown returned to Dr. Sykes in October with continuing pain that he\napportioned as 50% in the neck and 50% in the shoulders and arms. He also complained\nof constant headaches and numbness and tingling in his left arm. Dr. Sykes took Mr.\nBrown off work on October 28 and referred him back to Dr. Qamirani.\n\n       Dr. Qamirani saw Mr. Brown for the last time in November. Mr. Brown reported\n50% neck pain and 50% arm/shoulder pain, mostly in the left arm. He also complained of\nnumbness and weakness in both arms. Dr. Qamirani reviewed the June MRI, and he again\ndiffered with the radiologist as to the severity of the stenosis and nerve compression. He\nrepeated his recommendation for a cervical fusion at C3-4 and restricted Mr. Brown from\nworking until he had the surgery.\n\n       As before, Pulaski sent the recommendation to Dr. Lager for utilization review. Dr.\nLager quoted extensively from the 2023 denial, again observing that Dr. Qamirani\u2019s\nopinion that the April 2023 MRI showed severe foraminal stenosis was inconsistent with\nthe \u201cofficial\u201d MRI reading by the radiologist. He did not mention the October 2023 MRI\nor Dr. Sykes\u2019s records but did list them as records he reviewed. He referred to the June\n2024 MRI record but said that it only revealed mild bilateral stenosis, facet arthropathy,\nand a \u201cshallow left paracentral disc protrusion\u201d at C3-4. He did not see any evidence of\nneural compression or focal neurologic deficits. Once again he denied the fusion.\n\n      Mr. Brown appealed the utilization review denial to Dr. Snyder, who once again\nagreed, asserting it was not clear that the procedure would alleviate Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms\ndue to a history of headaches and shoulder involvement. He recommended \u201cfurther\ndiagnostic studies, EMG/NCV and second opinion.\u201d\n\n\n                                            3\n\f        In addition to medical records, Mr. Brown submitted Dr. Qamirani\u2019s deposition. He\nfirst established that Mr. Brown\u2019s injuries and need for a C-4 fusion primarily arose out of\nhis work-related injury. Mr. Brown required surgery because he developed pain in his left\narm and shoulder, and conservative treatment did not relieve his symptoms. He would not\nreach maximum medical improvement until after surgery.\n\n        As for the utilization review reports, Dr. Qamirani expressed concern that Dr. Lager\nfound significance in the fact that there were no neurological deficits at C4. He believed\nthis statement showed that Dr. Lager apparently did not know that the C4 nerve is a sensory\nnerve. Thus, compression would only cause pain, not neurological deficits.\n\n        On cross-examination, Dr. Qamirani confirmed his opinion that the April 2023 MRI\nshowed a C3-4 bulging disc with \u201csevere right and moderate left foraminal stenosis.\u201d He\ntestified that when he reviewed the June 2024 MRI film, he believed that it showed the\nsame level of stenosis he found in the April 2023 MRI, despite the radiologist\u2019s report of\nmild stenosis. Finally, Dr. Qamirani drew attention to the October 2023 MRI, noting that\nthe radiologist found evidence of severe foraminal stenosis at C3-4, which was much more\nin line with his own findings.\n\n       Pulaski offered Dr. Clendenin\u2019s deposition for its proof. When he first saw Mr.\nBrown, he complained of a recent onset of left-arm pain, so Dr. Clendenin ordered a\ncervical MRI. It was performed in October 2023 and revealed many degenerative arthritic\nchanges with severe right foraminal narrowing causing impingement of the C4 nerve root.\nHowever, he did not see any acute changes from the first MRI to account for the onset of\nleft-arm symptoms.\n\n       Dr. Clendenin said that he did not see any acute radiculopathy, and Mr. Brown\u2019s\npain was widespread and \u201cway out of the distribution of the C4.\u201d Surgery was not an\noption because the MRI only revealed degenerative and osteoarthritic changes with no\nacute disc herniations and did not correlate Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms with the MRI findings.\n\n        Dr. Clendenin testified that after he performed unsuccessful nerve blocks, he felt he\nhad exhausted treatment options and released Mr. Brown in November 2023. He admitted\nto not reviewing any records of Mr. Brown\u2019s later treatment, but he was not optimistic that\nsurgery would relieve Mr. Brown\u2019s symptoms.\n\n       On the issue of temporary disability benefits, Mr. Brown\u2019s affidavit stated that his\nlast payment for temporary disability benefits was on July 15, 2024. He was seeking\nbenefits from July 16, 2024, to the present and has not worked during this period because\nof his work injury.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f                       Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n       To obtain his requested benefits, Mr. Brown must show a likelihood of prevailing\nat a hearing on the merits that he is entitled to cervical fusion surgery and additional\ntemporary disability benefits. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 50-6-239(d)(1) (2024).\n\n        To establish entitlement, Mr. Brown must show he is likely to prove: (1) a work-\nrelated injury; (2) that surgery is reasonable and necessary for treating his injury; and (3)\nhe has yet to reach maximum medical improvement and has been unable to work since he\nlast received temporary disability benefits. The Court will address each issue in turn.\n\n        To prove a work-related injury, Mr. Brown must show that he sustained an injury\narising primarily arose out of and in the course of employment. \u00a7 50-6-102(14)(A). Dr.\nQamirani, the authorized physician, testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty\nthat Mr. Brown\u2019s current symptoms of neck pain with radiation into both shoulders and\narms primarily arose out of this accident. This opinion is presumed correct. \u00a7 50-6-\n102(14)(E). Pulaski did not submit contrary medical evidence, so the Court holds that Mr.\nBrown is likely to prove at a hearing that his cervical injury arose primarily in the course\nand scope of his employment.\n\n       The more complex issue is whether Dr. Qamirani\u2019s recommendation for a cervical\nfusion is reasonable and necessary to treat Mr. Brown\u2019s current symptoms.\n\n        The Appeals Board has held that \u201cthe utilization review system is intended to ensure\nthe availability of quality medical care services for injured and disabled employees and to\nmanage medical costs in workers\u2019 compensation matters.\u201d Gentry v. Arapazuma, Inc.,\n2022 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 30, at *12 (July 19, 2022). The burden of\nproduction is on an employer who chooses to challenge treatment prescribed by an\nauthorized physician. Id. at *14. A trial court \u201cis not bound by the determination of\nthe utilization review physician or the Bureau\u2019s Medical Director but is charged with\nconducting a de novo review to determine whether Employer rebutted the presumption that\nthe prescribed treatment is reasonably necessary to treat the work injury.\u201d Id.\n\n       On this issue, the medical evidence materially differs. When confronted with\nconflicting opinions, the Court has discretion to determine which opinion to accept.\nPatterson v. Huff & Puff Trucking, 2018 TN Wrk. Comp. App. Bd. LEXIS 33, at *9 (July\n6, 2018). The Court may consider, among other things, \u201cthe qualifications of the experts,\nthe circumstances of their examination, the information available to them, and the\nevaluation of the importance of that information by other experts.\u201d Orman v. Williams\nSonoma, Inc., 803 S.W.2d 672, 676 (Tenn. 1991).\n\n       Here, Dr. Qamirani is a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon with years of\nexperience. Dr. Clendenin is a board-certified physical medicine and rehabilitation\n\n                                             5\n\fspecialist. According to the utilization review report, Dr. Lager is a board-certified\northopedist. Drs. Snyder and Talmage are both board-certified orthopedists as well. While\nall the doctors are qualified to address cervical spine issues, the Court finds that Dr.\nQamirani, as a spine surgeon, is more qualified to address the reasonableness and necessity\nof a cervical fusion than the other physicians.\n\n       As to the circumstances of their examinations, Dr. Qamirani is Mr. Brown\u2019s\nauthorized treating physician, which entitles his opinion as to the reasonableness and\nnecessity of recommended treatment to a presumption of correctness. \u00a7 50-6-204(H). He\npersonally evaluated Mr. Brown several times, which allowed him to assess Mr. Brown\u2019s\ncredibility and his response to various modes of treatment. He was also the last doctor to\ntreat Mr. Brown. \u201cIt seems reasonable that the physicians having greater contact with the\nPlaintiff would have the advantage and opportunity to provide a more in-depth opinion, if\nnot a more accurate one.\u201d Id. at 677.\n\n      Dr. Clendenin saw Mr. Brown twice before releasing him and assigning maximum\nmedical improvement. He did not see Mr. Brown after he discharged him in 2023 and\nknew nothing of his later treatment. The other doctors who addressed the surgery issue\nonly performed record reviews. Under the circumstances, the Court finds that Dr.\nQamirani\u2019s history with Mr. Brown gives more weight to his opinion.\n\n       Finally, the Court considers the information available to each doctor and the weight\ngiven to this information. For this factor, the multiple cervical MRIs and the doctors\u2019\ninterpretations of them become significant. Dr. Qamirani disagreed with the radiologist\u2019s\nreports for the April 2023 and the November 2024 MRIs, concluding the film showed\nsevere foraminal stenosis rather than the mild stenosis the radiologist reported. He also\npointed out that the October 2023 MRI report supported his opinion. Dr. Qamirani is the\nonly doctor who documented reviewing the actual film.\n\n       Dr. Lager relied on the difference between Dr. Qamirani\u2019s and the radiologist\u2019s\nopinions of the severity of the foraminal stenosis in denying surgery. He also described\nthe 2024 MRI as only showing mild stenosis when the report described it as mild to\nmoderate. More significantly, he did not mention the October 2023 MRI report or Dr.\nSykes\u2019s records for the second utilization review denial except to list them as documents\nhe reviewed. Finally, Dr. Qamirani noted his concern that it did not appear Dr. Lager was\naware that the nerve at C3-4 was a sensory nerve and compression would cause only pain\nwith no neurological deficits. Pulaski did not produce any contrary evidence.\n\n       As for the medical directors\u2019 decisions upholding the utilization review denials,\nneither doctor offered justification for the denials.\n\n       For Dr. Clendenin\u2019s part, he acknowledged that the October 2023 MRI showed\nsevere foraminal stenosis at C3-4, which compressed the nerve root on the right. This is\n\n                                            6\n\fconsistent with Dr. Qamirani\u2019s assessment.\n\n       Dr. Clendenin also agreed that Mr. Brown complained of left-shoulder/arm pain\nwhen he saw him, although he gave a different weight to this fact than Dr. Qamirani. He\nbelieved the left-sided symptoms weighed against surgery, since Mr. Brown did not\nmention pain immediately after the accident. Dr. Qamirani felt the opposite, citing the fact\nthat Mr. Brown complained of pain that was 50% in his left shoulder/arm and 50% in the\nneck at his 2024 visit.\n\n       After considering the above, the Court finds that the information considered by the\ndoctors and the weight they gave to it also favors Dr. Qamirani\u2019s opinion.\n\n        Another significant factor is that no doctor has presented any other non-surgical\noptions to relieve Mr. Brown\u2019s complaints. He has undergone multiple courses of\nconservative treatment with no significant improvement. Likewise, no doctor has said that\nMr. Brown was not credible or that his symptoms were not real. The fact that Dr. Qamirani\nis offering a possible solution must weigh in favor of surgery. The Appeals Board upheld\na trial court order to authorize surgery, where the medical experts disagreed on its\nreasonable necessity, but they offered \u201cno countervailing recommendations for reasonable\nand necessary medical treatment.\u201d Burns-Herrera v. State Indus., LLC, 2022 TN Wrk.\nComp. App. Bd. LEXIS 37, at *17 (Sept. 12, 2022). The Court finds that the information\nconsidered by the doctors and the weight they gave to it also favors Dr. Qamirani.\n\n       After weighing all the evidence, the Court finds that Pulaski failed to overcome the\npresumption given to Dr. Qamirani\u2019s opinion. Mr. Brown has proven he is likely to prevail\nat a hearing on the merits regarding entitlement to surgery, and Pulaski must authorize the\nrecommended fusion at C3-4.\n\n       As to temporary total disability benefits, Mr. Brown must show the duration of his\nwork-related inability to work. See Shepherd v. Haren Const. Co., Inc., 2016 TN Wrk.\nComp. App. Bd. LEXIS 15, at *13 (Mar. 30, 2016). Mr. Brown requested benefits from\nJuly 16, 2024, through the present. He stated he has not worked since that time, and Pulaski\ndid not dispute that assertion. However, Dr. Sykes placed Mr. Brown at maximum medical\nimprovement on July 15, 2024, and did not take him off work again until October 28, when\nhe referred him back to Dr. Qamirani.\n\n        Dr. Qamirani then took Mr. Brown off work on November 11, 2024, until he\nundergoes the recommended surgery. He testified that Mr. Brown would not be at\nmaximum medical improvement until he had the surgery. However, he did not dispute that\nMr. Brown was at maximum medical improvement on July 15, 2024, and Dr. Sykes never\nrescinded that opinion. Thus, Mr. Brown has not met his burden of proving temporary\ntotal disability from July 16, 2024, through October 27, 2024.\n\n\n                                             7\n\f       However, given that the Court has determined that the surgery is reasonable and\nnecessary, it follows that, based on Dr. Qamirani\u2019s testimony, Mr. Brown is also likely to\nprove that he has been temporarily totally disabled from at least October 28, 2024, through\nthe present and will remain so until he undergoes surgery. Thus, he is likely to prevail at\na hearing on the merits regarding this request. The Court holds that Mr. Brown is entitled\nto temporary total disability benefits at the compensation rate of $919.07 from October 28,\n2024, forward.\n\n       IT IS, THEREFORE, ORDERED that:\n\n 1. Pulaski shall authorize and pay for Dr. Qamirani to perform the recommended fusions\n    at C3-4.\n\n 2. Pulaski shall pay Mr. Brown past temporary total disability benefits of $36,237.62.\n    Mr. Brown\u2019s attorney is entitled to 20% attorney\u2019s fees, or $7,247.52. Pulaski shall\n    continue to pay Mr. Brown temporary total disability benefits at the rate of $919.07\n    until he reaches maximum medical improvement or is able to return to work.\n\n 3.

The parties must call 615-253-0010 or 855-689-9049 to participate.\n    Failure to call might result in a determination of the issues without the party\u2019s\n    participation.\n\n 4.

To do so, you must:\n   1. Complete the enclosed form entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal\u201d and file it with the Clerk of the\n      Court of Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims before the expiration of the deadline.\n              \u00be If the order being appealed is \u201cexpedited\u201d (also called \u201cinterlocutory\u201d), or if the\n                 order does not dispose of the case in its entirety, the notice of appeal must be filed\n                 within seven (7) business days of the date the order was filed.\n              \u00be If the order being appealed is a \u201cCompensation Order,\u201d or if it resolves all issues\n                 in the case, the notice of appeal must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of\n                 the date the Compensation Order was filed.\n      When filing the Notice of Appeal, you must serve a copy on the opposing party (or attorney,\n      if represented).\n\n   2. You must pay, via check, money order, or credit card, a $75.00 filing fee within ten calendar\n      days after filing the Notice of Appeal. Payments can be made in-person at any Bureau office\n      or by U.S. mail, hand-delivery, or other delivery service. In the alternative, you may file an\n      Affidavit of Indigency (form available on the Bureau\u2019s website or any Bureau office)\n      seeking a waiver of the filing fee. You must file the fully-completed Affidavit of Indigency\n      within ten calendar days of filing the Notice of Appeal. Failure to timely pay the filing\n      fee or file the Affidavit of Indigency will result in dismissal of your appeal.\n\n   3. You are responsible for ensuring a complete record is presented on appeal. If no court\n      reporter was present at the hearing, you may request from the Court Clerk the audio\n      recording of the hearing for a $25.00 fee. If you choose to submit a transcript as part of your\n      appeal, which the Appeals Board has emphasized is important for a meaningful review of\n      the case, a licensed court reporter must prepare the transcript, and you must file it with the\n      Court Clerk. The Court Clerk will prepare the record for submission to the Appeals Board,\n      and you will receive notice once it has been submitted.

Held:\n\n         The trial court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of attorney\u2019s\n         fees and costs the defendant was entitled to recover, as pursuant to the\n         statute (\u00a7 42-110g (d)) providing for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs\n         under CUTPA, such fees and costs are limited to work reasonably performed\n         by an attorney related to the prosecution of a CUTPA claim and, on review\n         of the defendant\u2019s affidavit, his request for attorney\u2019s fees included fees for\n         matters unrelated thereto.\n                      Argued April 16\u2014officially released July 29, 2025\n\n                                      Procedural History\n\n            Action to recover damages for, inter alia, breach of\n         contract, and for other relief, brought to the Superior\n         Court in the judicial district of Danbury, where the\n         defendant filed a counterclaim; thereafter, the case was\n         tried to the court, Shaban, J.; judgment in part for the\n         plaintiff on the complaint and judgment in part for the\n         defendant on the counterclaim; subsequently, the court\n         granted the defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and\n         denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to reargue, and the plaintiff\n         appealed to this court.

Specifically,\n       the plaintiff claims that the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s\n       fees was not limited to those fees associated with the\n       defendant\u2019s CUTPA claim.2 We agree and, accordingly,\n       reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the\n       case for a new hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for\n       attorney\u2019s fees.3\n          The following facts, as found by the trial court, and\n       procedural history are relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\n       On July 19, 2022, the defendant entered into a written\n       lease with the plaintiff for the use and occupancy of\n       130 Head of Meadow Road in Newtown (premises) from\n       August 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023, at a rate of $3700\n       per month. The defendant paid a $7400 security deposit\n       to the plaintiff to secure the lease. \u2018\u2018Not long after taking\n       occupancy, problems arose between the parties.\u2019\u2019 The\n       defendant \u2018\u2018claimed that the premises was unfit for\n       human habitation and, on that basis, withheld rent for\n       the . . . months of . . . September and October,\n       2022.\u2019\u2019 Consequently, the plaintiff commenced a sum-\n       mary process action seeking possession of the prem-\n       ises. On October 28, 2022, the court in that action ren-\n       dered judgment of possession in favor of the plaintiff,\n         1\n            Pursuant to CUTPA, \u2018\u2018[n]o person shall engage in unfair methods of\n       competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any\n       trade or commerce.\u2019\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a).\n          Attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded for a violation of CUTPA pursuant to\n       General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (d).\n          2\n            The defendant did not file a brief in this appeal. We, therefore, have\n       considered this appeal on the basis of the record, the plaintiff\u2019s appellate\n       brief, and the plaintiff\u2019s oral argument before this court.\n          3\n            In light of our disposition, we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s additional\n       claim that the trial court erred by denying her motion to reargue the award\n       of attorney\u2019s fees.

The defendant, in turn, filed an answer, special\n         defenses, and a five count counterclaim. Pertinent to\n         this appeal, count two of the counterclaim alleged that\n         the plaintiff failed to place the defendant\u2019s security\n         deposit into an escrow account in violation of General\n         Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (h),4 and count five of the counter-\n         claim alleged multiple violations5 of CUTPA.6 The mat-\n         ter was tried before the court, Shaban, J., on July 12,\n         (2024); Doe v.

The remaining CUTPA violations alleged in count five of the\n         counterclaim consisted of several alleged violations of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) related\n         to the plaintiff\u2019s handling of the security deposit, the plaintiff\u2019s unauthorized\n         towing of the defendant\u2019s car, and the plaintiff\u2019s \u2018\u2018failure to provide smoke\n         alarms\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018to maintain the premises in a condition fit for habitation.\u2019\u2019\n            6\n              The remaining counts of the counterclaim alleged breach of contract\n         related to the plaintiff\u2019s handling of the security deposit (count one), harass-\n         ment and unlawful entry into premises (count three), and trespass to chattel\n         on the basis of the plaintiff having the defendant\u2019s car towed from the\n         premises (count four).\n\f0, 0                         CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                      Page 3\n\n\n\n\n       0 Conn.

On November 9, 2023, the court issued a memo-\n       randum of decision in which it found in favor of the\n       plaintiff on her claim of breach of contract for nonpay-\n       ment of rent and in favor of the defendant on counts\n       two and five of his counterclaim.7 With respect to count\n       two of the counterclaim, the court found that the plain-\n       tiff, \u2018\u2018by admission through her pleading and her own\n       testimony,\u2019\u2019 failed to deposit the defendant\u2019s security\n       deposit into an escrow account, as required by statute.\n       With respect to count five, the court found that the\n       plaintiff\u2019s violations of \u00a7 47a-21 (h) constituted viola-\n       tions of CUTPA.8 Specifically, with respect to the\n       CUTPA violations, the court relied on the plaintiff\u2019s\n       failure to place the security deposit into an escrow\n       account in violation of \u00a7 47a-21 (h) (1),9 and the plain-\n       tiff\u2019s failure to provide the defendant with certain infor-\n       mation regarding his security deposit in violation of\n       \u00a7 47a-21 (h) (4) (A).10 The court awarded the defendant\n       $500 in punitive damages on the CUTPA count of the\n       counterclaim.11 In addition, the court found that, \u2018\u2018[b]ecause\n         7\n            In addition, the court found in favor of the defendant on count four of\n       the counterclaim and in favor of the plaintiff on counts one and three of\n       the counterclaim. See footnote 6 of this opinion.\n          8\n            The court found in favor of the plaintiff with respect to the remaining\n       CUTPA violations alleged in count five of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. See\n       footnote 5 of this opinion.\n          9\n            The court reasoned: \u2018\u2018[T]his alone may not constitute a CUTPA violation.\n       However, coupled with the fact [that] the plaintiff withdrew the deposit\n       funds that were to have been escrowed for the defendant and then used\n       them for her own personal expenses, the court finds this constitutes both\n       a [statutory] violation . . . as well as a CUTPA violation. This was more\n       than a negligent failure to comply with the statute. It was an unscrupulous,\n       wilful and voluntary act to use the funds for her own personal expenses\n       outside of the enumerated uses authorized by the statute. . . . Simply put,\n       the actions of the plaintiff were unfair to the defendant.\u2019\u2019 (Citation omitted.)\n          10\n             The court reasoned: \u2018\u2018The failure to provide the information was an\n       unfair act with respect to the defendant as the funds belonged to him and\n       he had a right to know where they were being held. By failing to reveal the\n       information, the plaintiff effectively hid from the defendant her use of the\n       funds for her personal benefit.\u2019\u2019\n          11\n             On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge the court\u2019s award of puni-\n       tive damages.\n\fPage 4                         CONNECTICUT LAW JOURNAL                                       0, 0\n\n\n\n\n         6                           ,0                            0 Conn.

On\n         November 28, 2023, the plaintiff filed an objection to\n         the defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, in which she\n         argued, inter alia: \u2018\u2018CUTPA allows for [the award of]\n         \u2018reasonable [attorney\u2019s] fees\u2019 . . .

[Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited\n         to the questions of whether the trial court correctly\n         applied the law and reasonably could have reached\n         the conclusion that it did.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks\n         omitted.)

Brown, supra, 57 Conn.\n       App. 192, the plaintiff brought an action against the\n       defendants, Laverne Brown and the city of Hartford,\n       for breach of two separate home improvement con-\n       tracts, one private contract with Brown, and the other\n       contract with the city. Brown, in turn, asserted a coun-\n       terclaim consisting of three counts, one of which alleged\n       a violation of CUTPA. Id., 193. Brown prevailed on her\n       CUTPA counterclaim and moved for an award of attor-\n       ney\u2019s fees, upon which \u2018\u2018the court ordered Brown\u2019s\n       counsel to provide an itemized account of the time and\n       expense required to litigate the CUTPA claim.\u2019\u2019 Id., 200.\n       Brown subsequently submitted a bill totaling $19,413.50,\n       which the trial court awarded to Brown as attorney\u2019s\n       fees under CUTPA. Id. On cross appeal to this court,\n       Brown claimed that the trial court improperly calcu-\n       lated her attorney\u2019s fees. Specifically, she contended\n       that, pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (d), \u2018\u2018she [was] entitled to all\n       attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the defense of [the plaintiff\u2019s]\n       action and the prosecution of her counterclaim.\u2019\u2019\n       (Emphasis in original.) Id. This court disagreed and\n       concluded that the trial court properly limited its award\n       of attorney\u2019s fees solely to the fees Brown \u2018\u2018incurred in\n       the pursuit of her CUTPA claim\u2019\u2019 and properly excluded\n       the \u2018\u2018fees [related to] her other counterclaims.\u2019\u2019 Id.\n         In Heller v.

App. 1\n                             Pearlman v. Gervolino\n\n         under CUTPA. Id., 734. In response, the trial court\n         \u2018\u2018ordered the plaintiffs to submit evidence as to the\n         portion of the fees requested specifically related to the\n         CUTPA [claim],\u2019\u2019 which the plaintiffs were unable to do\n         because of the close factual connection between the\n         claims. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 735.\n         Because the plaintiffs were unable to apportion the\n         fees, the trial court, relying on Jacques All Trades Corp.,\n         denied their motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Id. In reversing\n         the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees, this court\n         distinguished cases in which the factual basis of a\n         CUTPA claim is integral to, rather than separate from,\n         the facts underlying other claims. Specifically, this court\n         held that the trial court improperly relied on Jacques\n         All Trades Corp. in ordering the plaintiffs to apportion\n         their attorney\u2019s fees among their claims because, \u2018\u2018[i]n\n         the present case, the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract and\n         negligence claims were related to their CUTPA claim\n         because they depended on the same facts.\u2019\u2019 Id., 735; see\n         also Taylor v. King, 121 Conn. App. 105, 131, 994 A.2d\n         330 (2010) (\u2018\u2018when the facts underlying the CUTPA\n         claim are indistinguishable from those facts relating to\n         other claims, \u00a7 42-110g (d) encompasses claims related\n         to the prosecution of a CUTPA claim . . . not only one\n         claim explicitly labeled as a CUTPA claim\u2019\u2019 (internal\n         quotation marks omitted)).\n             Thus, in the present case, the defendant\u2019s award of\n         attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (d) was limited to\n         those fees related to the prosecution of the CUTPA\n         count of his counterclaim. Our review of the defendant\u2019s\n         affidavit, however, reveals that his request for attorney\u2019s\n         fees was not limited to only those fees. For example,\n         some of the fees listed therein were incurred by coun-\n         sel\u2019s \u2018\u2018[r]eview of [the summary process] case\u2019\u2019 and\n         \u2018\u2018[r]esearch [of] mortgage and federal eviction morato-\n         rium\u2019\u2019 and the filing of an unsuccessful motion to open\n         in the summary process action.

These itemized entries,\n       however, do not apportion the corresponding fees\n       among the defendant\u2019s various counts of his counter-\n       claim. And, although certain entries appear to relate\n       solely to the defendant\u2019s CUTPA count of his counter-\n       claim,16 these services were billed in conjunction with\n       more general services relating to the entire litigation,\n       such as \u2018\u2018trial preparation\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018[r]eview of new plead-\n       ings.\u2019\u2019 In calculating the defendant\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s\n       fees, however, the court included in its award all the\n       costs and fees set forth in the defendant\u2019s affidavit.\n       Because the court did not limit its award of attorney\u2019s\n       fees to those fees incurred on the defendant\u2019s CUTPA\n       claim, but, rather, expressly awarded the defendant all\n       \u2018\u2018attorney\u2019s fees and [costs incurred] in the defense of\n       the plaintiff\u2019s action and the prosecution of his counter-\n       claims,\u2019\u2019 we conclude that the court abused its discre-\n       tion in calculating the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and\n       costs the defendant was entitled to recover under\n       CUTPA.17\n         The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded\n       for a new hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for attor-\n       ney\u2019s fees.\n          In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n         16\n             Namely, several itemized entries in the affidavit concern the defendant\u2019s\n       objection to the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike the CUTPA count of the counter-\n       claim.\n          17\n             In the plaintiff\u2019s brief to this court, she suggests that the trial court\n       \u2018\u2018sought to punish [her] by awarding additional fees to the defendant beyond\n       what was authorized by law\u2019\u2019 because she had failed to appear at the January\n       23, 2024 hearing. The record is devoid of any evidence to support the\n       plaintiff\u2019s contention. We emphasize that \u2018\u2018[t]he term abuse of discretion\n       does not imply a bad motive or wrong purpose but merely means that the\n       ruling appears to have been made on untenable grounds.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation\n       marks omitted.)

In two issues, Reyes contends that the trial court erred in\n\ngranting Fiesta\u2019s hybrid motion for summary judgment because (1) she presented\n\fevidence that Fiesta had actual or constructive knowledge of the premises condition\n\nand (2) adequate time for discovery had not elapsed at the time the trial court granted\n\nthe motion.\n\n       We affirm.\n\n                                     Background\n\n       In her petition, Reyes alleged that on October 30, 2020, she was shopping at\n\nthe Fiesta grocery store located at 2877 Rickey Street, in Houston, Texas, when she\n\nslipped and fell on a substance on the floor of the produce department, injuring\n\nherself.\n\n       Reyes sued Fiesta asserting claims for negligence and premises liability. She\n\nalleged that her fall and resulting injuries were caused by Fiesta\u2019s failure to properly\n\nmaintain its premises in a safe manner. With respect to her premises liability claim,\n\nReyes alleged that (1) she was an invitee, (2) Fiesta was a possessor of the premises,\n\n(3) a condition on the premises posed an unreasonable risk of harm, (4) Fiesta knew\n\nor reasonably should have known of the danger, (5) Fiesta breached its duty of\n\nordinary care by failing to (a) adequately warn Reyes of the condition and (b) make\n\nthe condition reasonably safe, and (6) Fiesta\u2019s breach proximately caused her\n\ninjuries.\n\n       Fiesta answered, generally denying the allegations in Reyes\u2019s petition and\n\nasserting certain defenses and limitations on liability and damages.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f      Fiesta filed a hybrid traditional and no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment. As to its no-evidence motion, Fiesta asserted that an adequate time for\n\ndiscovery had elapsed and Reyes could not produce any evidence to support the\n\nnotice element of her premises liability claim. As to its traditional motion, Fiesta\n\nasserted that even if Reyes had produced more than a scintilla of evidence to\n\nestablish each of the essential elements of her claim, her deposition testimony and\n\nwritten admissions conclusively established that Fiesta did not have actual\n\nknowledge of a substance on the floor before Reyes fell. It further asserted that to\n\nprove constructive notice, Reyes was required to provide temporal evidence showing\n\nhow long the condition existed prior to her fall, but she had failed to do so. It also\n\nasserted that Reyes was barred from bringing a general negligence claim against it.1\n\nFiesta attached to its summary judgment motion Reyes\u2019s responses to Fiesta\u2019s first\n\nrequest for admissions, excerpts from Reyes\u2019s deposition transcript, and\n\nphotographs taken by Reyes\u2019s daughter.\n\n\n\n1\n      Fiesta argued that Reyes\u2019s general negligence claim was barred because her\n      allegations gave rise solely to a premises liability claim and that negligence and\n      premises liability claims arising from an alleged unreasonably dangerous condition\n      are mutually exclusive. Reyes did not address this ground either in her summary\n      judgment response in the trial court or in her briefing on appeal and has therefore\n      waived it. See D.R. Horton\u2013Tex., Ltd. v. Markel Int\u2019l Ins. Co., Ltd., 300 S.W.3d\n      740, 743 (Tex. 2009) (concluding failure to present issue to defeat summary\n      judgment in trial court waives issue on appeal); see also TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i)\n      (requiring brief on appeal to contain clear and concise argument for contentions\n      made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to record).\n\n                                           3\n\f      In her summary judgment response, Reyes asserted that Fiesta had actual and\n\nconstructive knowledge of the substance on the floor prior to her fall. According to\n\nReyes, the evidence showed that (1) Fiesta believed the area in which Reyes fell was\n\nopen and obvious and that it had adequately warned her of the conditions, (2) there\n\nwere no signs or cones in the area warning her of the condition, and (3) a Fiesta\n\nemployee was performing his job duties in the area at the time Reyes fell. As\n\nsummary judgment evidence, Reyes attached to her response Fiesta\u2019s original\n\nanswer, its initial disclosures and responses to her requests for production,\n\nphotographs, and Reyes\u2019s deposition transcript.\n\n      In its summary judgment reply, Fiesta asserted that Reyes\u2019s premises liability\n\nclaim failed because she had not presented legally sufficient evidence of Fiesta\u2019s\n\nactual or constructive knowledge of the substance on the floor. Fiesta asserted that\n\nReyes presented no evidence (1) that the Fiesta employee who was stocking nearby\n\nknew there was a substance on the floor, (2) that any Fiesta employee was aware of\n\na substance on the floor prior to Reyes\u2019s fall, and (3) of the length of time the\n\nsubstance had been on the floor prior to her fall. Rather, it asserted, Reyes admitted\n\nthat she had no evidence that Fiesta had actual or constructive knowledge of the\n\nsubstance on the floor where Reyes slipped.\n\n      Reyes filed a supplemental summary judgment response, asserting that Fiesta\n\nhad deliberately withheld discovery responses that would have led to evidence of\n\n\n                                          4\n\fFiesta\u2019s actual and constructive knowledge of the premises condition, and that it had\n\nfailed to preserve evidence that could potentially prove Reyes\u2019s premises liability\n\nclaim. She asserted that Fiesta\u2019s original interrogatory responses, stating that a\n\nFiesta employee had been cleaning the floor at the time that Reyes fell and that Fiesta\n\nhad placed a \u201cwet floor\u201d sign in the area being cleaned, contradicted Fiesta\u2019s\n\nassertion in its summary judgment motion that it did not have knowledge of the\n\ncondition that caused the fall. Reyes attached to her supplemental response Fiesta\u2019s\n\ndiscovery responses, her deposition transcript, and her affidavit. In her affidavit,\n\nReyes stated that there was a Fiesta employee stocking fruit nearby when she fell,\n\nand she did not see any signs warning of a dangerous condition.\n\n         Reyes filed an amended petition, alleging that Fiesta had engaged in spoliation\n\nof evidence and requesting that the trial court grant a spoliation presumption in her\n\nfavor.\n\n         Fiesta filed a supplemental reply in support of its motion for summary\n\njudgment. It argued that Reyes\u2019s failure to conduct discovery was due to her own\n\ninaction rather than the result of nondisclosure by Fiesta. Fiesta reiterated its\n\nassertion that Reyes\u2019s premises liability claim failed because she could not establish\n\nFiesta\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of the premises condition. With respect\n\nto Reyes\u2019s spoliation request, Fiesta argued that Reyes had not shown that Fiesta\n\nshould have anticipated litigation and so was not entitled to a spoliation instruction.\n\n\n                                            5\n\fFiesta asserted that it had complied with its duty to amend its answer and discovery\n\nresponses once it obtained additional information related to Reyes\u2019s fall. It attached\n\nthe declaration of Luis Amaro, the Fiesta store manager, to its supplemental reply.\n\nAmaro stated that he did not know there was anything on the floor prior to Reyes\u2019s\n\nfall, and he was neither aware of, nor able to identify, anyone who knew there was\n\nanything on the floor prior to her fall. Amaro further stated that he had reviewed the\n\nstore\u2019s videotape surveillance recording which showed a Fiesta employee cleaning\n\nthe general produce department and that a cone had been placed in the area after\n\nFiesta was notified of Reyes\u2019s fall. Amaro explained that there was no videotaped\n\nrecording of Reyes\u2019s fall or the area itself. Fiesta objected to Reyes\u2019s summary\n\njudgment affidavit and moved to strike it as untimely.\n\n      On June 12, 2023, the trial court held a hearing on Fiesta\u2019s summary judgment\n\nmotion which was continued to July 17, 2023. Following the hearing, on July 17,\n\n2023, the trial court signed an order granting Fiesta summary judgment on Reyes\u2019s\n\nclaims against it. This appeal followed.\n\n                            Summary Judgment\n\n      In her first issue, Reyes contends that the trial court erred in granting Fiesta\n\nsummary judgment on her premises liability claim because she presented more than\n\na scintilla of evidence to support each element of her claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fA.    Standard of Review\n\n      We review a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment de\n\nnovo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). A party\n\nseeking summary judgment may combine in a single motion a request for summary\n\njudgment under the no-evidence standard with a request under the traditional\n\nsummary judgment standard. Binur v. Jacobo, 135 S.W.3d 646, 650 (Tex. 2004).\n\nWhen, as here, a party has sought summary judgment on both grounds and the order\n\ndoes not specify which motion was granted, we typically first review the propriety\n\nof the summary judgment under the no-evidence standard. See TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n166a(i); Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004). If the\n\nnonmovant fails to meet her burden to adduce evidence in response to the no-\n\nevidence motion, there is no need to address the challenge to the traditional motion\n\nbecause it necessarily fails. Merriman v. XTO Energy, Inc., 407 S.W.3d 244, 248\n\n(Tex. 2013).\n\n      After an adequate time for discovery, a party may move for no-evidence\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that no evidence exists of one or more essential\n\nelements of the claim on which the adverse party bears the burden of proof at trial.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see LMB, Ltd. v. Moreno, 201 S.W.3d 686, 688 (Tex. 2006).\n\nThe burden then shifts to the nonmovant to produce evidence raising a genuine issue\n\nof material fact on the elements specified in the motion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i);\n\n\n                                         7\n\fMack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex. 2006). A no-evidence\n\nsummary judgment is improper if the nonmovant brings forth more than a scintilla of\n\nprobative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact. Forbes, Inc. v. Granada\n\nBioscis., Inc., 124 S.W.3d 167, 172 (Tex. 2003). \u201cLess than a scintilla of evidence\n\nexists when the evidence is so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise or\n\nsuspicion of a fact.\u201d Id. at 172 (quoting King Ranch v. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742,\n\n751 (Tex. 2003) (internal quotations omitted)). More than a scintilla exists if it\n\nwould allow reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Id.\n\nUnless the nonmovant raises a genuine issue of material fact, the trial court must\n\ngrant summary judgment. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i).\n\n      A party who files a no-evidence summary judgment motion pursuant to Rule\n\n166a(i) essentially requests a pretrial directed verdict. Mack Trucks, 206 S.W.3d at\n\n581. We review the evidence presented by the summary judgment record in the light\n\nmost favorable to the party against whom summary judgment was rendered,\n\ncrediting evidence favorable to that party if reasonable jurors could and disregarding\n\ncontrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. Id. at 582 (citing City of Keller\n\nv. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005)).\n\n      When reviewing a traditional summary judgment motion, we take as true all\n\nevidence favorable to the nonmovant, and we indulge in every reasonable inference\n\nand resolve any doubts in the nonmovant\u2019s favor. Valence Operating, 164 S.W.3d\n\n\n                                          8\n\fat 661 (citing Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215\n\n(Tex. 2003)). To prevail on a traditional summary judgment motion, the movant\n\nmust establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that it is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\nB.    Applicable Law\n\n      Generally, premises owners owe a duty to protect invitees2 from, or warn them\n\nof, conditions posing unreasonable risks of harm if the owners knew of the\n\nconditions or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of them. Henkel\n\nv. Norman, 441 S.W.3d 249, 251 (Tex. 2014). To prevail on a premises liability\n\nclaim against a property owner, an injured invitee must establish that (1) a premises\n\ncondition created an unreasonable risk of harm to the invitee; (2) the owner knew or\n\nreasonably should have known of the condition; (3) the owner failed to exercise\n\nordinary care to protect the invitee from the danger; and (4) the owner\u2019s failure was\n\na proximate cause of injury to the invitee. Fort Brown Villas III Condo. Ass\u2019n, Inc.\n\nv. Gillenwater, 285 S.W.3d 879, 883 (Tex. 2009); CMH Homes, Inc. v. Daenen, 15\n\nS.W.3d 97, 99 (Tex. 2000). The threshold requirement in a premises liability claim\n\nis the existence of actual or constructive knowledge of an unreasonably dangerous\n\n\n\n\n2\n      An invitee is \u201cone who enters on another\u2019s land with the owner\u2019s knowledge and\n      for the mutual benefit of both.\u201d Hillis v. McCall, 602 S.W.3d 436, 440 n.6 (Tex.\n      2020) (internal quotations omitted).\n\n                                           9\n\fcondition on the premises. See Motel 6 G.P., Inc. v. Lopez, 929 S.W.2d 1, 3 (Tex.\n\n1996).\n\n      The standard of care required of the owner toward its invitees is the ordinary\n\ncare that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the same or similar\n\ncircumstances. Farrar v. Sabine Mgmt. Corp., 362 S.W.3d 694, 699 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (citing Corbin v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 648 S.W.2d\n\n292, 295 (Tex. 1983)). While a premises owner is not an insurer of its invitees\u2019\n\nsafety, it must protect invitees from conditions on the property that present an\n\nunreasonable risk of harm. Brinson Ford, Inc. v. Alger, 228 S.W.3d 161, 162\u201363\n\n(Tex. 2007).\n\nC.    Notice\n\n      In its summary judgment motion, Fiesta challenged the notice element of\n\nReyes\u2019s premises liability claim. To avoid summary judgment, Reyes was therefore\n\nrequired to present evidence that Fiesta had notice of the premises condition, i.e., the\n\nsubstance on the floor.\n\n      In the context of slip-and-fall cases, a plaintiff satisfies the notice element by\n\nestablishing one of three things: (1) the defendant placed a substance on the floor;\n\n(2) the defendant actually knew the substance was on the floor; or (3) it is more\n\nlikely than not that the dangerous condition had existed long enough to give the\n\npremises owner a reasonable opportunity to discover it. Wal\u2013Mart Stores, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                          10\n\fReece, 81 S.W.3d 812, 814 (Tex. 2002). The \u201cactual knowledge\u201d required for\n\npremises liability is of the dangerous condition at the time of the incident. City of\n\nDallas v. Thompson, 210 S.W.3d 601, 603 (Tex. 2006). \u201cConstructive knowledge\n\nis a substitute in the law for actual knowledge.\u201d CMH Homes, 15 S.W.3d at 102.\n\nConstructive knowledge is \u201cwhat a person after a reasonable inspection ought to\n\nknow or have reason to know.\u201d Mendia v. Fiesta Mart, L.L.C., No. 01-19-00018-\n\nCV, 2021 WL 3412175, at *4\u20135 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 5, 2021, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.). Reyes did not present any summary judgment evidence showing\n\nthat a Fiesta employee placed the substance on the floor. Therefore, she was required\n\nto present evidence that Fiesta had either actual or constructive knowledge of the\n\npremises condition. We first consider whether Reyes presented more than a scintilla\n\nof evidence that Fiesta had actual knowledge.\n\n      1.     Actual Knowledge\n\n      In its summary judgment motion, Fiesta asserted that Reyes had presented no\n\nevidence that it had actual knowledge of the substance on the floor prior to her fall.\n\nIt pointed to Reyes\u2019s deposition testimony and admission that she was not aware of\n\nany Fiesta employee who knew there was a substance on the floor prior to her fall\n\nor who knew the source of the substance. It further asserted that there was no\n\nevidence that the Fiesta employee whom Reyes testified was placing produce on a\n\ndisplay nearby or any other Fiesta employee knew there was a substance on the floor\n\n\n                                         11\n\fprior to Reyes\u2019s fall.3 Fiesta also pointed to Reyes\u2019s admission that she had no\n\nevidence that Fiesta knew about the substance on the floor prior to her fall:\n\n      REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 22: Admit that [y]ou have no\n      evidence that Fiesta had actual knowledge that the alleged substance\n      was present on the floor before your fall.\n\n             RESPONSE: ADMIT.\n\n      In her supplemental summary judgment response, as on appeal, Reyes\n\nasserted that the evidence showed that Fiesta had actual knowledge that the floor\n\nwas wet. She pointed to Fiesta\u2019s original interrogatory response stating \u201c[Reyes]\n\nignored a wet floor sign and proceeded through an area where a produce clerk was\n\ncleaning the floor, causing her[] to slip and fall.\u201d Reyes asserted that Fiesta amended\n\nits interrogatory response more than a year later to state that a cone was placed in\n\nthe area after Fiesta was notified of Reyes\u2019s fall and while an employee began\n\ncleaning the general department. According to Reyes, Fiesta amended its response\n\n\u201conly to match\u201d the assertion in its summary judgment motion that it had no\n\nknowledge of the substance on the floor.\n\n      Fiesta responded that it had minimal information regarding the facts\n\nsurrounding the fall when it first responded to Reyes\u2019s suit. According to Fiesta, it\n\namended its discovery responses once it learned from Amaro, the Fiesta store\n\n\n3\n      In her deposition, Reyes testified that the cart used by the Fiesta employee who\n      appeared to be \u201ccleaning\u201d the produce before placing it out on display was not a\n      mopping or janitorial-type cart but rather a regular shopping cart.\n\n                                           12\n\fmanager, that the warning cone had, in fact, been placed in the general area while an\n\nemployee was cleaning the entire area as a precaution after Fiesta became aware of\n\nthe fall. Fiesta correctly points out that it had a duty to amend or supplement its\n\nwritten discovery responses upon obtaining this additional information.4 Notably,\n\nFiesta\u2019s amended discovery responses are consistent with Reyes\u2019s own admission as\n\nwell as her deposition and affidavit testimony that there were no warning cones or\n\nwet floor signs in the area when she fell.\n\n      Reyes cites Coffee v. F.W. Woolworth Co. to argue that Fiesta\u2019s actual\n\nknowledge could be inferred from the fact that a store employee was placing produce\n\non a display nearby. 536 S.W.2d 539 (Tex. 1976). In Coffee, the plaintiff was\n\ninjured when she tripped over an empty display pallet on the floor of a Woolworth\n\nstore used to hold merchandise. See id. at 540. The jury found that Woolworth had\n\ncreated the dangerous condition and knew or should have known of it. Id. The court\n\nof appeals reversed, finding that the record contained no direct evidence that\n\nWoolworth had actual knowledge that the display pallet was empty. Coffee v. F.W.\n\nWoolworth Co., 526 S.W.2d 793, 795 (Tex. Civ. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg\n\n1975), rev\u2019d, 536 S.W.2d at 539. The Texas Supreme Court disagreed with the court\n\n\n\n4\n      See TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.5 (stating party must amend or supplement written\n      discovery if it \u201clearns that the party\u2019s response to written discovery was incomplete\n      or incorrect when made, or, although complete and correct when made, is no longer\n      complete and correct\u201d).\n\n                                             13\n\fof appeals, reasoning that the jury could have found that Woolworth had actual\n\nknowledge of the dangerous condition because store employees were actually\n\nworking on the display stand in question thereby creating the dangerous condition.\n\nSee 536 S.W.2d at 540\u201341. Here, by contrast, there is no evidence that a Fiesta\n\nemployee created the condition that caused Reyes to fall. And while Reyes testified\n\nthat a Fiesta employee was nearby stocking fruit from a cart onto a display shelf at\n\nthe time she fell, Reyes does not claim that she fell on the fruit. Coffee does not\n\nsupport Reyes\u2019s actual knowledge argument.\n\n      No evidence established that Fiesta actually knew of the substance on the\n\nfloor. Thus, we conclude that Reyes failed to meet her burden of producing a\n\nscintilla of evidence showing actual knowledge of the condition.\n\n      2.    Constructive Knowledge\n\n      We next consider whether Reyes presented more than a scintilla of evidence\n\nthat Fiesta had constructive knowledge of the substance on the floor. Courts analyze\n\nthe combination of proximity, conspicuity, and longevity of the dangerous condition\n\nin determining whether to attribute constructive knowledge. Wal\u2013Mart Stores, Inc.\n\nv. Spates, 186 S.W.3d 566, 567\u201368 (Tex. 2006).\n\n      Temporal evidence, i.e., evidence of the length of time the dangerous\n\ncondition existed, is the best indication of whether the premises owner had a\n\nreasonable opportunity to discover and remedy the condition. Reece, 81 S.W.3d at\n\n\n                                        14\n\f816. \u201cAn employee\u2019s proximity to a hazard, with no evidence indicating how long\n\nthe hazard was there, merely indicates that it was possible for the premises owner to\n\ndiscover the condition, not that the premises owner reasonably should have\n\ndiscovered it.\u201d Id. Temporal evidence is necessary for the factfinder to reasonably\n\nassess the opportunity that the premises owner had to discover the condition. Id. A\n\nreasonable time for the owner to discover the condition varies depending upon the\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case, and evidence of an employee\u2019s proximity to\n\nthe hazard \u201cwill often be relevant to the analysis.\u201d Id. For example, if a dangerous\n\ncondition is conspicuous, or an employee was in close proximity to a less\n\nconspicuous hazard for a \u201ccontinuous and significant period of time,\u201d an employee\u2019s\n\nproximity might shorten the time period in which the factfinder could find that the\n\npremises owner should have reasonably discovered the condition. Id. However,\n\nevidence of close proximity and conspicuousness of a condition are insufficient,\n\nalone, to prove constructive knowledge; temporal evidence \u201cof how long the hazard\n\nwas there\u201d is required. Id.\n\n      Reyes presented no evidence of how long the substance had been on the floor\n\nbefore she fell. In her deposition testimony and discovery responses, Reyes stated\n\nthat she did not know how long the substance had been on the floor prior to her fall,\n\nand she was not aware of anyone who knew how long the substance had been on the\n\nfloor before she fell. Reyes further stated that she did not know the last time the area\n\n\n                                          15\n\fhad been inspected prior to her fall nor was she aware of any statement by a Fiesta\n\nemployee indicating when the area had last been inspected. See Coburn v. Toys \u201cR\u201d\n\nUs-Del., Inc., No. 01-09-00871-CV, 2011 WL 345936, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] Feb. 3, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding plaintiff failed to present fact\n\nissue as to constructive knowledge because plaintiff presented no evidence of how\n\nlong substance was on the floor before she fell, no evidence that store employee saw\n\nspill before fall, and no evidence that substance was there when employee made her\n\nstore rounds about fifteen to twenty minutes before plaintiff fell). Reyes also\n\nadmitted that she had no evidence showing that Fiesta had constructive knowledge\n\nof the substance on the floor prior to her fall:\n\n      REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 22: Admit that [y]ou have no\n      evidence that Fiesta had constructive knowledge that the alleged\n      [s]ubstance was present on the floor before [y]our fall.\n\n             A: ADMIT.\n\n      We conclude that Reyes did not meet her burden to produce a scintilla of\n\nevidence showing that Fiesta had constructive knowledge of the condition. We\n\ntherefore hold that the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof Fiesta on Reyes\u2019s premises liability claim against it.\n\n      We overrule Reyes\u2019s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f                          Adequate Time for Discovery\n\n      In her second issue, Reyes contends that the trial court erred in granting\n\nFiesta\u2019s no-evidence motion for summary judgment because she did not have\n\nadequate time for discovery and thus the motion was premature.\n\n      A party may move for a no-evidence summary judgment only \u201c[a]fter\n\nadequate time for discovery.\u201d TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). The rule does not require that\n\ndiscovery must have been completed, only that there was \u201cadequate time.\u201d Specialty\n\nRetailers, Inc. v. Fuqua, 29 S.W.3d 140, 145 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2000, pet. denied). In determining whether the trial court has permitted an adequate\n\ntime for discovery, we generally consider the following non-exclusive factors: (1)\n\nthe nature of the cause of action; (2) the nature of the evidence necessary to\n\ncontrovert the no-evidence motion; (3) the length of time the case has been active in\n\nthe trial court; (4) the amount of time the no-evidence motion has been on file; (5)\n\nwhether the movant has requested stricter time deadlines for discovery; (6) the\n\namount of discovery that has already taken place; and (7) whether the discovery\n\ndeadlines that are in place are specific or vague. Mendia, 2021 WL 3412175, at *6.\n\nA.    Nature of Case and Evidence Necessary to Controvert Motion\n\n      Reyes alleged that she slipped and fell on a substance on the floor of a Fiesta\n\ngrocery store. The case involves two parties and concerns the threshold issue of\n\nwhether Fiesta had actual or constructive knowledge of an unreasonably dangerous\n\n\n                                         17\n\fcondition on the premises. This case is not of a nature that would require extensive\n\nor complex discovery. See McClure v. Attebury, 20 S.W.3d 722, 729 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nAmarillo 1999, no pet.).\n\n      As to the nature of the evidence necessary to controvert Fiesta\u2019s no-evidence\n\nmotion, Reyes asserts that she was unable to obtain a videotape surveillance\n\nrecording of her fall. According to Reyes, the Fiesta store manager told her sister\n\nthat the entire incident had been captured by the store\u2019s videotape surveillance\n\ncamera but Fiesta refused to produce the videotape recording in discovery and later\n\nstated that it did not have a recording of the incident.\n\n      The record does not support Reyes\u2019s assertion. In her deposition, Reyes\n\ntestified that the Fiesta store manager told her sister that he would review the nearby\n\nvideotape surveillance camera to see what had occurred. In his sworn declaration,\n\nthe store manager stated that he had reviewed the recording from the store\u2019s nearest\n\nvideotape surveillance camera and determined that the camera had not captured the\n\nfall or the incident area, and therefore there was no videotape recording of the\n\nincident.\n\nB.    Length of Time Case and Motion on File\n\n      Reyes filed suit against Fiesta on March 3, 2022. On January 27, 2023, the\n\ntrial court granted Fiesta\u2019s agreed motion for continuance extending all deadlines by\n\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\f180 days.5 The case had been active for approximately fourteen months when Fiesta\n\nfiled its summary judgment motion on May 8, 2023. The summary judgment\n\nhearing on Fiesta\u2019s motion that was held on June 12, 2023 was continued to July 17,\n\n2023, allowing the parties an additional month of discovery. The trial court granted\n\nFiesta\u2019s summary judgment motion on July 17, 2023. Fiesta\u2019s no-evidence motion\n\nhad been on file more than two months at the time of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Courts\n\nhave held that shorter periods of time provided an adequate time for discovery. See,\n\ne.g., Gomes v. Casey, No. 02-22-00003-CV, 2022 WL 3464611, at *3 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nFort Worth Aug. 18, 2022, no pet.) (mem. op.) (holding plaintiff had had adequate\n\ntime for discovery because defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion had been filed\n\nmore than six months after commencement of lawsuit and had been on file for\n\ntwenty-seven additional days before it was granted); Barton Food Mart, Inc. v.\n\nBotrie, No. 03-17-00292-CV, 2018 WL 5289538, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin Oct. 25,\n\n2018, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (concluding adequate time for discovery had passed\n\nwhere case had been on file for thirteen months when summary judgment motion\n\nwas filed and trial court granted motion in part following month); Rest. Teams Int\u2019l,\n\nInc. v. MG Secs. Corp., 95 S.W.3d 336, 340 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2002, no pet.)\n\n(finding adequate time for discovery had passed where case had been on file for\n\n\n5\n      The record does not contain the trial court\u2019s May 11, 2022 scheduling and docket\n      control order. According to the parties, the order granting the continuance extended\n      the discovery and dispositive motion deadlines to August 4, 2023.\n\n                                           19\n\fseven months at time motion was filed and motion had been on file for twenty-six\n\ndays before it was granted).\n\nC.    Amount of Discovery and Deadlines\n\n      We also consider the amount of discovery that took place, whether Fiesta\n\nrequested stricter deadlines for discovery, and whether the discovery deadlines that\n\nwere in place were specific or vague.\n\n      The parties had propounded and responded to discovery and Reyes\u2019s\n\ndeposition had been taken at the time Fiesta filed its summary judgment motion.\n\nReyes complains that Fiesta requested several extensions of the written discovery\n\ndeadlines, but the record does not show that Fiesta\u2019s requests for extensions or that\n\nsubsequent written responses and objections were opposed or untimely. Reyes also\n\nasserts that she emailed Fiesta\u2019s counsel in June and October 2022 to discuss\n\nscheduling depositions but received no response. The emails are not included in the\n\nrecord. The record shows that Fiesta provided the names of its two employees\n\ninvolved in the investigation of the fall\u2014the employee who first responded and the\n\nstore manager to whom Reyes referred in her deposition\u2014on May 2, 2022, when its\n\ninitial disclosures were served. Thus, Reyes had more than a year to request their\n\ndepositions prior to the filing of summary judgment but the record is void of\n\nevidence showing that she did. Further, the record does not show that Reyes\n\nrequested or attempted to notice any depositions between the original June 12, 2023\n\n\n                                         20\n\fsummary judgment hearing and the filing of her supplemental summary judgment\n\nresponse on July 10, 2023.\n\n      Fiesta did not request stricter discovery deadlines. Rather, it sought a 180-day\n\nextension of all deadlines which the trial court granted. Finally, the discovery\n\ndeadlines in this case were specific. The trial court ordered that \u201cthe deadlines set\n\nforth in the Scheduling and Docket Control Order dated May 11, 2022 and\n\npreviously entered in this case be extended by 180 days.\u201d\n\n      Under these circumstances, we hold that Reyes failed to show that the trial\n\ncourt erred in granting the no-evidence summary judgment because she did not have\n\nan adequate time for discovery.\n\nD.    Spoliation\n\n      In a sub-issue, Reyes asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment because Fiesta spoliated evidence.\n\n      1.     Applicable Law\n\n      Spoliation of evidence occurs when a party (1) deliberately destroys or fails\n\nto preserve relevant evidence or (2) when it fails to produce relevant evidence or to\n\nexplain its non-production. Wal\u2013Mart Stores, Inc. v. Johnson, 106 S.W.3d 718, 721\n\n(Tex. 2003). Under the first scenario, a party who deliberately destroys evidence \u201cis\n\npresumed to have done so because the evidence was unfavorable to its case.\u201d Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fUnder the second scenario, \u201cthe presumption arises because the party controlling the\n\nmissing evidence cannot explain its failure to produce it.\u201d Id. at 722.\n\n      Whether a party has engaged in spoliation of evidence is a preliminary\n\nevidentiary question for the court and not for a jury. Brookshire Bros., Ltd. v.\n\nAldridge, 438 S.W.3d 9, 20 (Tex. 2014). The \u201cspoliation analysis involves a\n\ntwo-step judicial process: (1) the trial court must determine, as a question of law,\n\nwhether a party spoliated evidence, and (2) if spoliation occurred, the court must\n\nassess an appropriate remedy.\u201d Id. at 14. To find that a party spoliated evidence,\n\n\u201cthe court must find that (1) the spoliating party had a duty to reasonably preserve\n\nevidence, and (2) the party intentionally or negligently breached that duty by failing\n\nto do so.\u201d Id.\n\n      The doctrine of spoliation can apply in the summary judgment context. See\n\nClark v. Randalls Food, 317 S.W.3d 351, 356 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2010,\n\npet. denied). If a trial court concludes that the movant in a motion for summary\n\njudgment engaged in spoliation of evidence, the court may, but is not required to,\n\ndraw an inference that the evidence would have been favorable to the non-movant.\n\nAdobe Land Corp. v. Griffin, L.L.C., 236 S.W.3d 351, 356 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth\n\n2007, pet. denied). When a trial court grants summary judgment against a party\n\narguing spoliation, it is implied that the trial court denied the request for a spoliation\n\npresumption. See id. at 356\u201357 (presuming trial court considered and rejected\n\n\n                                           22\n\fplaintiffs\u2019 request for spoliation presumption where plaintiffs raised issue of\n\nentitlement to presumption in response to defendant\u2019s no-evidence summary\n\njudgment motion and trial court nonetheless granted no-evidence motion). A ruling\n\ndenying a spoliation request is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. at 357. Because\n\nReyes argued that Fiesta\u2019s summary judgment motion should be denied because it\n\nspoliated evidence crucial to her claim, and the trial court nevertheless granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Fiesta, we presume the trial court considered and\n\nrejected Reyes\u2019s spoliation request. See id. at 356\u201357.\n\n      2.     Breach of Duty\n\n      To determine whether Reyes was entitled to a spoliation presumption, we\n\nconsider whether (1) there was a duty to preserve evidence, (2) the alleged spoliator\n\nbreached that duty, and (3) the spoliation prejudiced the non-spoliator\u2019s ability to\n\npresent its case or defense. Clark, 317 S.W.3d at 356. The duty to preserve evidence\n\n\u201carises only when a party knows or reasonably should know that there is a substantial\n\nchance that a claim will be filed and that evidence in its possession or control will\n\nbe material and relevant to that claim.\u201d Brookshire Bros., 438 S.W.3d at 20. A duty\n\nto preserve evidence arises when a reasonable person would conclude from the\n\nseverity of an accident or other circumstances that a substantial chance of litigation\n\nexists. See In re Advanced Powder Sols., Inc., 496 S.W.3d 838, 854 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2016, no pet.). Further, \u201c[a] party must preserve what it knows\n\n\n                                         23\n\for reasonably should know is relevant in the action, is reasonably calculated to lead\n\nto the discovery of admissible evidence, is reasonably likely to be requested during\n\ndiscovery, or is the subject of a pending discovery sanction.\u201d Clark, 317 S.W.3d at\n\n357. The party alleging spoliation bears the burden of establishing the alleged\n\nspoliator had a duty to preserve the evidence in question and breached that duty. See\n\nBrookshire Bros., 438 S.W.3d at 20.\n\n      Assuming without deciding that Fiesta had a duty to preserve any existing\n\nvideotape surveillance recording of the incident, Reyes did not establish that Fiesta\n\nbreached its duty. An alleged spoliator can defend against an assertion of negligent\n\nor intentional destruction by providing other explanations to justify its failure to\n\npreserve evidence. Clark, 317 S.W.3d at 358; Adobe Land Corp., 236 S.W.3d at\n\n359. Here, Amaro, the Fiesta store manager, stated in his sworn declaration that\n\nupon reviewing the videotape surveillance recording from the closest store camera,\n\nhe determined that the camera did not capture the incident or the incident area.\n\nReyes failed to meet her burden to establish that Fiesta intentionally or negligently\n\nbreached its duty to preserve a videotape surveillance recording of the incident\n\nbecause such a recording did not exist. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to grant a spoliation presumption in Reyes\u2019s favor.\n\n      We overrule Reyes\u2019s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f                                   Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Kristin Guiney\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Adams and Justices Gunn and Guiney.\n\n\n\n\n                                        25"

In three issues, HAIC\n\ncontends that the trial court erred because (1) HAIC complied with its obligations\n\nunder the insurance policy, as a matter of law, when it paid the appraisal award and\n\nstatutory interest to Menchaca and, thus, he cannot recover on his contract or extra-\n\ncontractual counterclaims, (2) mental anguish that allegedly results from the denial\n\nof an insurance claim, as in this case, is not a recoverable \u201cindependent injury\u201d and\n\nMenchaca failed to present legally sufficient evidence of mental anguish, and (3)\n\nMenchaca\u2019s insurance claim was paid in full and he therefore cannot recover any\n\nfees under Texas Insurance Code section 542A.007, and he failed to present legally\n\nsufficient evidence to support his claim for attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n      We reverse and render.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      After his house was damaged during Hurricane Harvey, Menchaca filed a\n\nclaim under his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy with HAIC on August 27, 2017.\n\nHAIC sent an adjuster to Menchaca\u2019s house to inspect the claimed damage on\n\nAugust 31, 2017. Following inspection, HAIC sent Menchaca a letter explaining its\n\nfindings and its claim decision. HAIC estimated that the cost of covered repair to\n\nMenchaca\u2019s house was $3,688.54, which was less than his deductible, and therefore\n\nno payment would be made.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f       After Menchaca retained counsel, HAIC requested that it be allowed to\n\nreinspect the loss in response to any claim for additional damages and that Menchaca\n\nprovide supporting documentation for any additional claimed damages. HAIC also\n\nadvised that, under the terms of the policy, Menchaca was required to first invoke\n\nthe appraisal process prior to filing suit, and that HAIC reserved the right to request\n\nthat Menchaca and any adjuster hired on his behalf submit to an Examination Under\n\nOath (\u201cEUO\u201d).\n\n       On August 23, 2018, Menchaca\u2019s counsel sent a demand notice letter to HAIC\n\nstating that Menchaca had sustained $48,757.98 in economic damages based on an\n\nestimate prepared by Henry Sienema, Vice President of Case Strategies Group. The\n\nletter demanded that HAIC pay $48,757.98 in actual damages, $2,400 in attorney\u2019s\n\nfees, and $2,000 in expenses, totaling $53,157.98, to resolve the matter without\n\nlitigation.\n\n       On September 6, 2018, HAIC invoked the appraisal process as set forth under\n\nthe policy, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n       E. Appraisal\n\n       If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand\n       an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a\n       competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a\n       written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an\n       umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we\n       may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court or record in\n       the state where the \u201cresidence premises\u201d is located. The appraisers will\n       separately set the amount of loss. If the appraisers submit a written\n                                          3\n\f      report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the\n      amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences\n      to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of\n      loss.\n\n      HAIC appointed an appraiser and reiterated its request to Menchaca for\n\nsupporting documentation. Menchaca appointed Sienema as his appraiser. HAIC\n\nexpressed concerns that, given his association with Case Strategies Group, Sienema\n\nwas not \u201cqualified\u201d under the terms of the policy which require that an appraiser (1)\n\n\u201cbe competent, impartial, and disinterested,\u201d (2) \u201cbe licensed or certified as required\n\nby the applicable jurisdiction,\u201d and (3) not \u201chave a financial interest that is\n\nconditioned on the outcome of the appraisal or the claim.\u201d HAIC requested that\n\nSienema disclose his qualifications and fee arrangement within seven days as\n\nrequired under the policy. It also requested EUOs of, and documentation from,\n\nMenchaca and Sienema so that it could evaluate Menchaca\u2019s claim of additional\n\ndamages. Menchaca\u2019s counsel responded that Menchaca was not available for an\n\nEUO at that time.\n\n      On February 19, 2019, HAIC filed suit for declaratory judgment against\n\nMenchaca seeking declarations that Menchaca and Sienema were required to submit\n\nto separate EUOs, Sienema was not a qualified appraiser, and Menchaca must\n\nappoint a qualified appraiser, and it requested attorney\u2019s fees. On April 22, 2019,\n\nthe parties entered into a Rule 11 agreement; HAIC agreed to pass its hearing setting\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fand Menchaca agreed to submit to an EUO, withdraw Sienema as his appraiser, and\n\nappoint a qualified appraiser.\n\n      The next day, Menchaca answered, generally denying the allegations in\n\nHAIC\u2019s petition, and counterclaimed asserting violations of the Texas Insurance\n\nCode, fraud, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,\n\nand violations of the Texas Prompt Payment of Claims Act (\u201cTPPCA\u201d).1 Menchaca\n\nalso sought attorney\u2019s fees.     HAIC answered, generally denying Menchaca\u2019s\n\nallegations and asserting several affirmative defenses.\n\n      On June 3, 2019, Menchaca appointed Bobby Crowson as his new appraiser.\n\nMenchaca appeared for his EUO on March 24, 2021.2\n\n      On June 1, 2021, HAIC\u2019s appraiser and the agreed umpire signed an appraisal\n\naward setting the amount of loss for Menchaca\u2019s claim. On June 4, 2021, without\n\nadmitting liability, HAIC issued a check to Menchaca in the amount of $7,085.86\u2014\n\nthe actual cash value of $13,145.86 assigned by the appraisers minus the $6,060\n\ndeductible under Menchaca\u2019s policy.\n\n      HAIC moved for summary judgment on Menchaca\u2019s counterclaims. It argued\n\nthat his breach of contract claim failed because Menchaca failed to comply with the\n\n\n\n1\n      See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 541.060, 542.056-.058.\n2\n      Although initially scheduled for March 18, 2020, Menchaca\u2019s EUO was postponed\n      due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n                                          5\n\fconditions precedent and his duties under the policy, which included his failures to\n\nsubmit to the required EUO and sign it.          HAIC asserted that Menchaca\u2019s\n\ncounterclaims for bad faith and fraud, whether under Chapter 541 of the Texas\n\nInsurance Code or the common law, failed because the appraisal award disposed of\n\nany contract breach without which the claims were unsupportable, and the inordinate\n\ndelay caused by Menchaca\u2019s actions were not evidence of HAIC\u2019s bad faith but\n\nrather evidence of a bona fide dispute as to the amount of loss. Thus, Menchaca\n\ncould not show that HAIC\u2019s liability had become \u201creasonably clear\u201d as required to\n\nestablish his counterclaims. HAIC argued that Menchaca\u2019s counterclaim that it had\n\nviolated the TPPCA also failed because Menchaca had not complied with the\n\nconditions precedent under the policy of (1) submitting to an EUO and signing it,\n\n(2) providing the requested documents, and (3) proceeding in appraisal with a\n\n\u201cqualified appraiser,\u201d thereby creating the delay for which he now sought four years\n\nof penalty interest on the $7,085.86 appraisal award.\n\n      Menchaca responded to HAIC\u2019s summary judgment motion arguing that the\n\nappraisal award did not dispose of his counterclaims. He asserted that if HAIC were\n\ncorrect that payment of the appraisal award extinguished his breach-of-contract\n\ncounterclaim, then HAIC\u2019s declaratory judgment action\u2014which was grounded in a\n\nbreach-of-contract claim\u2014was likewise extinguished. He argued that HAIC\u2019s delay\n\nin payment of the appraisal award did not insulate HAIC from liability under the\n\n\n                                         6\n\fTPPCA as a matter of law or defeat any of his other counterclaims. Menchaca\n\nasserted that HAIC\u2019s unfair settlement practice of refusing to pay his claim for loss\n\nwithout conducting a reasonable investigation violated section 541.060(7) of the\n\nTexas Insurance Code.       Menchaca argued that HAIC\u2019s conduct in grossly\n\nundervaluing the damage to his property constituted a breach of the underlying\n\npolicy, fraud, and breaches of HAIC\u2019s duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n\n      HAIC replied that its payment of the appraisal award to Menchaca disposed\n\nof every one of Menchaca\u2019s counterclaims, except his counterclaim under the\n\nTPPCA for penalty interest and fees. As to his TPPCA counterclaim, Menchaca\u2019s\n\nnoncompliance and noncooperation throughout the claims process and litigation\n\ndemonstrated that Menchaca\u2019s counterclaim for penalty interest was not payable.\n\nHis counterclaim for attorney\u2019s fees under Chapter 542 of the Texas Insurance Code\n\nwas precluded as a matter of law because a $7,085.86 award payment (which capped\n\nthe damages judgment Menchaca could obtain, if the entire award was proved to be\n\nwithin coverage) on a $53,157.98 demand resulted in an amount less than 0.2.3\n\n      The trial court denied HAIC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on August 25,\n\n2020, and later denied its motion for reconsideration.\n\n      HAIC filed its declaration invoking offer of settlement procedures and served\n\na statutory offer of settlement on Menchaca which expired without acceptance.\n\n\n3\n      See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 542A.007(c).\n                                          7\n\fHAIC tendered $2,550.91 to Menchaca, which HAIC alleged was the maximum\n\namount of statutory interest he could recover on his counterclaim under Chapter 542\n\nof the Insurance Code if HAIC were found liable on the counterclaim.\n\n      HAIC filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment, which the trial\n\ncourt denied.\n\n      Menchaca moved for summary judgment on HAIC\u2019s claim for declaratory\n\nrelief and its request for attorney\u2019s fees. He argued that no actual live controversy\n\nexisted, and therefore, HAIC was not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees and he was\n\nentitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. The trial court denied Menchaca\u2019s\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n      On February 7, 2023, Menchaca filed his first amended answer and\n\ncounterclaims. Under his claims for bad faith insurance practices and breach of the\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing, the amended pleading alleged for the first time:\n\n       [HAIC] committed bad faith insurance practices after the claim was\n       over and the appraisal was paid. . . . [HAIC] exercised bad faith\n       against . . . Menchaca after the claims process was over. In other\n       words, [HAIC] caused [Menchaca] damages not found under the\n       insurance policy. [HAIC] improperly maintained a lawsuit against\n       [Menchaca] after the claim was paid and ended. As such, any damages\n       arising from such are damages not under the policy.\n\n      In response, HAIC moved to strike the amended pleading on the grounds that\n\nit (1) was filed more than two years beyond the pleadings amendment deadline set\n\nin the docket control order, (2) alleged new, outside-the-policy damages based on\n\n\n                                          8\n\fHAIC\u2019s alleged post-appraisal bad faith, (3) was on the eve of trial and Menchaca\n\nadmitted in his request for continuance to having conducted no discovery, and (4)\n\nwas filed within seven days of the date of trial and without seeking leave of court as\n\nrequired by Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 63.4 The trial court granted HAIC\u2019s\n\nmotion to strike Menchaca\u2019s amended answer and counterclaims.\n\n      Trial began on February 13, 2023, and lasted four days. The jury returned a\n\nverdict for Menchaca.5 It found:\n\n      \u2022 Menchaca did not fail to comply with the policy;\n\n      \u2022 HAIC failed to comply with the policy with regard to Menchaca\u2019s\n        claim;\n\n      \u2022 The actual cash value of the covered damages to Menchaca\u2019s property\n        was $13,145.86;6\n\n      \u2022 HAIC engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice;7\n\n\n4\n      See TEX.

P. 63.\n5\n      The jury returned a ten-to-two verdict in favor of Menchaca.\n6\n      This was the amount of the appraisal award.\n7\n      The jury charge instructed:\n\n      \u201cUnfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d means any of the following:\n\n             \u2022   Misrepresenting to a claimant a material fact or policy provision\n                 relating to the coverage at issue, or\n             \u2022   Failing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and\n                 equitable settlement of a claim or part of a claim when the insurer\u2019s\n                 liability has become reasonably clear, or\n\n                                             9\n\f      \u2022 HAIC failed to comply with its duty of good faith and fair dealing;\n\n      \u2022 Menchaca sustained $300,000 in past mental anguish damages based upon\n        HAIC\u2019s unfair or deceptive act or practice(s) and its failure to comply with\n        its duty of good faith and fair dealing; and\n\n      \u2022 the reasonable and necessary fees for Menchaca\u2019s attorneys was\n        $250,000.\n\n      The trial court rendered final judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict on May 31, 2023,\n\nordering that Menchaca recover from HAIC $300,000 in mental anguish damages,\n\n$250,000 for his reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees, and $93,000 in pre-\n\njudgment interest. This appeal followed.\n\n                                      Discussion\n\n      In its first issue, HAIC contends that the trial court erred in rendering\n\njudgment in favor of Menchaca because HAIC complied with its obligations under\n\nthe policy, as a matter of law, when it paid the appraisal award. In its second issue,\n\nHAIC argues that the trial court erred in awarding Menchaca $300,000 in mental\n\nanguish damages because mental anguish that results from the denial of an insurance\n\nclaim is not a recoverable \u201cindependent injury.\u201d Menchaca responds that he suffered\n\n\n\n\n             \u2022   Refusing to pay a claim or part of a claim without conducting a\n                 reasonable investigation of the claim.\n             The same conduct may constitute a breach of the duty of good faith\n             under Question No. 8 and an unfair or deceptive act or practice under\n             this question[.]\n\n\n                                          10\n\fan independent injury as a result of HAIC\u2019s extreme conduct that occurred outside\n\nthe adjusting process and was not authorized by the insurance contract. Because\n\nHAIC\u2019s conduct occurred independent of the policy benefits, he was entitled to\n\nrecover mental anguish damages based on HAIC\u2019s misconduct. Because these\n\nissues are intertwined, we address them together.\n\nA.    Breach of Contract Counterclaim\n\n      The record shows that, on June 1, 2021, HAIC\u2019s appraiser and the agreed\n\numpire signed an appraisal award setting the amount of loss for Menchaca\u2019s claim.\n\nIt is undisputed that HAIC paid the appraisal award of $7,085.86 to Menchaca on\n\nJune 4, 2021. This amount represented the actual cash value of $13,145.86 assigned\n\nby the appraisers minus the $6,060 deductible under Menchaca\u2019s policy.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ortiz v. State Farm Lloyds, 589\n\nS.W.3d 127 (Tex. 2019) is instructive. There, Ortiz submitted a claim to State Farm\n\nunder his homeowner\u2019s insurance policy for wind and hail damage to his home. See\n\nid. at 129. State Farm sent an adjuster to inspect the property, and the adjuster\n\nestimated the amount of damages caused by wind or hail to be $723.53, which was\n\nunder the policy\u2019s $1,000 deductible. Id. In response to State Farm\u2019s request, Ortiz\n\nsent State Farm an estimate he received from a public adjuster valuing the loss at\n\n$23,525.99. Id. State Farm conducted a second inspection with the public adjuster\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\fpresent and revised the damage estimate to $973.94, again concluding the damage\n\namount did not exceed the deductible. Id.\n\n      Ortiz sued State Farm for breach of contract, violations of the TPPCA, and\n\nstatutory and common law bad faith insurance practices. Id. at 129\u201330. After filing\n\nits answer, State Farm demanded an appraisal pursuant to the parties\u2019 insurance\n\npolicy. Id. at 130. State Farm paid the appraisal award, minus the deductible,\n\napproximately seven business days after receiving it. Id. State Farm then moved\n\nfor summary judgment, arguing that its payment of the appraisal award \u201cresolve[d]\n\nand dispose[d] of all claims in this lawsuit.\u201d Id. After it initially denied the motion,\n\non reconsideration, the trial court granted it and rendered a final judgment that Ortiz\n\ntake nothing on his claims against State Farm. Id. The court of appeals affirmed,\n\nholding that, absent a ground for setting aside an appraisal award, an insurer\u2019s timely\n\npayment of the award forecloses liability for breach of contract. Id.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court agreed. It noted that Ortiz\u2019s breach-of-contract\n\nclaim was premised on the fact that the appraisal award valued the covered loss in\n\nan amount greater than State Farm had initially assessed. See id. at 132. It concluded\n\nthat Ortiz\u2019s argument\u2014that if an appraisal award is higher than the amount the\n\ninsurer offered, then the insurer necessarily breached the policy\u2014ignored the\n\nlanguage, purpose, and effect of the appraisal provisions. See id. The Court held:\n\n      Having invoked the agreed procedure for determining the amount of\n      loss, and having paid that binding amount, State Farm complied with\n                                          12\n\f      its obligations under the policy. . . . As Ortiz has failed to identify any\n      breach other than the failure to timely pay the amount of the covered\n      loss under the policy, State Farm was entitled to summary judgment on\n      the breach of contract claim.\n\nId. at 133.\n\n      Here, Menchaca\u2019s breach-of-contract counterclaim alleged, in its entirety, that\n\n\u201c[HAIC]\u2019s failure and refusal to pay the adequate compensation as it is obligated to\n\ndo under the terms of the policy in question, and under the laws of the State of Texas,\n\nconstitutes a breach of contract with [Menchaca].\u201d Having invoked the agreed\n\nprocedure for determining the amount of loss, and having paid that binding amount,\n\nHAIC complied with its obligations under the policy. See id. HAIC\u2019s payment of\n\nthe appraisal award in the face of Menchaca\u2019s allegation of pre-appraisal\n\nunderpayment forecloses liability on his breach-of-contract counterclaim. See id. at\n\n132; see also Anderson v. Am. Risk Ins. Co., No. 01-15-00257-CV, 2016 WL\n\n3438243, at *4\u20135 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] June 21, 2016, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (concluding insurer fulfilled its obligations under policy by invoking appraisal\n\nprocess, appraisal award was set, and insurer tendered payment of appraisal award\n\nafter accounting for deductible, prior payments, and policy limits).\n\nB.    Extra-Contractual Counterclaims\n\n      In his live pleading, Menchaca asserted counterclaims for unfair settlement\n\npractices in violation of section 541.060 of the Texas Insurance Code and breach of\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fthe duty of good faith and fair dealing. He alleged that HAIC engaged in unfair\n\nsettlement practices by:\n\n    \u2022 misrepresenting to Menchaca material facts relating to the coverage at\n      issue;\n\n    \u2022 failing to attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable\n      settlement of the claim, even though liability under the Policy is\n      reasonably clear;\n\n    \u2022 failing to promptly provide Menchaca with a reasonable explanation of\n      the basis in the policy, in relation to the facts or applicable law, for the\n      offer of a compromise settlement of Menchaca\u2019s claim;\n\n    \u2022 failing within a reasonable time to affirm or deny coverage of the claim\n      to Defendant or to submit a reservation of rights to Defendant; and\n\n    \u2022 refusing to pay Menchaca\u2019s claim without conducting a reasonable\n      investigation.\n\nSee TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 541.060(a)(1), (2)(A), (3), (4), (7). For his unfair\n\nsettlement practices claim, Menchaca sought \u201cactual damages, which include the\n\nloss of the benefits that should have been paid pursuant to the policy, court costs,\n\nand attorney\u2019s fees . . . for knowing conduct of the acts complained of, [Menchaca]\n\nasks for three times the actual damages.\u201d\n\n      Menchaca\u2019s pleading asserted that HAIC\u2019s unfair practices also breached the\n\nduty of good faith and fair dealing. For this claim, Menchaca sought \u201ccompensatory\n\ndamages, including all forms of loss resulting from the insurer\u2019s breach of duty, such\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fas additional costs, economic hardship, losses due to nonpayment of the amount the\n\ninsurer owed, exemplary damages, and damages for emotional distress.\u201d\n\nC.    \u201cIndependent Injury\u201d\n\n      Menchaca argues that he was entitled to recover on his extracontractual bad\n\nfaith claims because he suffered an \u201cindependent injury\u201d caused by HAIC\u2019s conduct\n\noutside the adjusting process and which was not authorized by the contract.\n\n      Mental anguish damages are generally not recoverable for the types of\n\nconduct prohibited by the Texas Insurance Code\u2014such as failing to timely pay a\n\nclaim, failing to adequately investigate a claim, or failing to explain the basis for a\n\nclaim decision\u2014because in those situations, any \u201cmental anguish\u201d would stem or\n\nflow from the denial of the claim for benefits. See USAA Tex. Lloyds Co. v.\n\nMenchaca, 545 S.W.3d 479, 500 (Tex. 2018). However, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nhas recognized the possibility that in denying a claim, an insurer may commit some\n\nact\u2014an act \u201cso extreme\u201d\u2014that would cause injury independent of the policy claim.\n\nSee id. at 499. If an insurer\u2019s statutory violation causes an injury independent of the\n\ninsured\u2019s right to recover policy benefits, the insured may recover damages for that\n\ninjury even if the policy does not entitle the insured to receive benefits. See id. Thus,\n\nan insured can recover actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s bad faith conduct if\n\nthe damages are separate from and differ from benefits under the contract. See id.\n\nThis aspect of the independent injury rule applies only if the damages are truly\n\n\n                                           15\n\findependent of the insured\u2019s right to receive policy benefits. See id. at 499\u2013500.\n\nThe Court has noted that a statutory violation that could cause an independent injury\n\nclaim would be rare, \u201cand we have yet to encounter one.\u201d Id. at 500 (quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n      Menchaca asserts that his mental anguish was not caused by the way in which\n\nHAIC adjusted his loss or its failure to pay policy benefits. Rather, his mental\n\nanguish damages were caused by HAIC\u2019s extreme actions after the adjustment took\n\nplace, namely, HAIC\u2019s filing suit against him and its alleged cancellation of his\n\npolicy.8\n\n      Menchaca\u2019s original answer and counterclaims\u2014the live pleading at the time\n\nof trial\u2014alleged emotional distress as a result of HAIC\u2019s purported \u201cfailure to\n\nadequately and reasonably investigate [Menchaca\u2019s] claims.\u201d As noted above,\n\nmental anguish caused by this type of claims-handling misconduct does not give rise\n\nto a recoverable \u201cindependent injury\u201d because mental anguish under these\n\ncircumstances stems or flows from the denial of the claim for benefits. See Ortiz,\n\n589 S.W.3d. at 134; Menchaca, 545 S.W.3d at 500. Menchaca\u2019s assertion in his\n\nbrief that his mental anguish was caused by HAIC\u2019s misconduct after the adjustment\n\ntook place\u2014when it sued him and allegedly cancelled his policy\u2014is unavailing.\n\nMenchaca did not allege these additional bases for his mental anguish claim in his\n\n8\n      According to HAIC, it did not renew Menchaca\u2019s policy; it did not cancel it.\n\n                                          16\n\flive pleading, but rather only in his amended answer and counterclaims which the\n\ntrial court struck before trial.\n\n       We conclude that Ortiz forecloses Menchaca\u2019s claims for violations of section\n\n541.060 of the Texas Insurance Code and breach of the duty of good faith and fair\n\ndealing. As we discussed above, the only actual damages Menchaca sought were\n\nlost policy benefits which HAIC paid when it paid the appraisal award. See Ortiz,\n\n589 S.W.3d at 129. Further, under Ortiz, Menchaca may not recover (1) court costs\n\nand reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees or (2) an award of up to three times the\n\namount of actual damages if the trier of fact finds appellee acted knowingly. See\n\nTEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 541.152(a)(1), (b); Ortiz, 589 S.W.3d at 135\u201336 (\u201cBy the\n\nstatute\u2019s terms, any award of attorney\u2019s fees or treble damages is premised on an\n\naward of underlying \u2018actual damages.\u2019 However, the only \u2018actual damages\u2019 Ortiz\n\nseeks are the policy benefits wrongfully withheld, and those benefits have already\n\nbeen paid pursuant to the policy.\u201d). For the reasons discussed above, we hold that\n\nthe trial court erred in rendering judgment in favor of Menchaca on his contractual\n\nand extracontractual claims and awarding him $300,000 in mental anguish damages.\n\n       We sustain HAIC\u2019s first and second issues.9\n\n\n\n\n9\n       In light of our disposition, we do not reach HAIC\u2019s additional argument that\n       Menchaca failed to present legally sufficient evidence of mental anguish. See TEX.\n       R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n                                           17\n\fD.    Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n      In its third issue, HAIC contends that the trial court erred in awarding\n\nMenchaca $250,000 in attorney\u2019s fees because his insurance claim has been paid in\n\nfull and thus he is not entitled to recover any fees under Texas Insurance Code\n\nsection 542A.007 and Rodriguez v. Safeco Insurance Co. of Indiana, 684 SW.3d 789\n\n(Tex. 2024). It further asserts that Menchaca failed to present legally sufficient\n\nevidence to support his attorney\u2019s fees counterclaim. Menchaca responds that he\n\nwas awarded attorney\u2019s fees as a result of the declaratory judgment claim filed by\n\nHAIC against him, and not as a result of any of his counterclaims, and thus the\n\nattorney\u2019s fees award was permissible under the Texas Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act (\u201cUDJA\u201d).10 He further asserts that he presented sufficient evidence\n\nto support the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n      Chapter 542 of the Texas Insurance Code imposes deadlines for the payment\n\nof certain insurance claims. See TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 542.057\u2013.059. Failure to\n\nmeet these deadlines results in statutory liability for interest and \u201creasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Id. \u00a7 542.060.\n\n      In 2017, the Texas Legislature added Chapter 542A to the Texas Insurance\n\nCode. See id. \u00a7 542A.001\u2013.007. Chapter 542A governs first-party claims by an\n\n\n10\n      See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 37.009 (\u201cIn any proceeding under this\n      chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees as\n      are equitable and just.\u201d).\n\n                                           18\n\finsured that arise \u201cfrom damage to or loss of covered property caused, wholly or\n\npartly, by forces of nature, including an earthquake or earth tremor, a wildfire, a\n\nflood, a tornado, lightning, a hurricane, hail, wind, a snowstorm, or a rainstorm.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00a7 542A.001(2)(C). With an exception not relevant here, Chapter 542A of the Texas\n\nInsurance Code applies to \u201can action on a claim against an insurer or agent, including\n\n. . . an action alleging a breach of contract . . . negligence, misrepresentation, fraud,\n\nor breach of a common law duty.\u201d Id. \u00a7 542A.002(a)(1), (2). Because Menchaca\u2019s\n\ncounterclaims against HAIC in this case arise from weather-related damage to his\n\nhouse, Chapter 542A applies.\n\n      Among its provisions, Chapter 542A limits the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nSee id. \u00a7 542A.007. It provides:\n\n      (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amount of\n      attorney\u2019s fees that may be awarded to a claimant in an action to which\n      this chapter applies is the lesser of:\n\n          (1) the amount of reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees\n          supported at trial by sufficient evidence and determined by the\n          trier of fact to have been incurred by the claimant in bringing the\n          action;\n\n          (2) the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that may be awarded to the\n          claimant under other applicable law; or\n\n          (3) the amount calculated by:\n\n            (A) dividing the amount to be awarded in the judgment to\n                the claimant for the claimant\u2019s claim under the\n                insurance policy for damage to or loss of covered\n                property by the amount alleged to be owed on the claim\n                                           19\n\f                for that damage or loss in a notice given under this\n                chapter; and\n\n            (B) multiplying the amount calculated under Paragraph\n                (A) by the total amount of reasonable and necessary\n                attorney\u2019s fees supported at trial by sufficient evidence\n                and determined by the trier of fact to have been\n                incurred by the claimant in bringing the action.\n\nId. Subsection (c) of section 542A.007 further provides that \u201c[t]he court may not\n\naward attorney\u2019s fees to the claimant if the amount calculated under Subsection\n\n(a)(3)(A) is less than 0.2.\u201d Id. \u00a7 542A.007(c).\n\n      In the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Rodriguez, the Fifth Circuit\n\ncertified the following question to the Court: \u201cIn an action under Chapter 542A of\n\nthe Texas Prompt Payment of Claims Act, does an insurer\u2019s payment of the full\n\nappraisal award plus any possible statutory interest preclude recovery of attorney\u2019s\n\nfees?\u201d Rodriguez, 684 SW.3d at 790. In answering \u201cyes,\u201d the Court explained:\n\n             Although the mathematical calculation described by section\n      542A.007(a)(3) is somewhat detailed, it is not unclear or ambiguous.\n      The allowable amount of attorney\u2019s fees is \u201ccalculated by . . . [first]\n      dividing the amount to be awarded in the judgment to the claimant for\n      the claimant\u2019s claim under the insurance policy for damage to or loss\n      of covered property\u201d by another amount. TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7\n      542A.007(a)(3)(A). The fraction generated by this initial step (which\n      can be greater or less than 1) is then multiplied \u201cby the total amount of\n      reasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees supported at trial . . . .\u201d Id. \u00a7\n      542A.007(a)(3)(B).\n\n            When the statutorily required calculation is applied to\n      Rodriguez\u2019s case, a problem arises at the first step of the formula.\n      Because the insurer has already paid all amounts owed under the\n      insurance policy plus any possible statutory interest, there is not and\n                                         20\n\f       never will be an \u201camount to be awarded in the judgment to the claimant\n       for the claimant\u2019s claim under the insurance policy.\u201d See Ortiz v. State\n       Farm Lloyds, 589 S.W.3d 127, 132\u201333 (Tex. 2019) (holding that an\n       insurer\u2019s payment of the appraisal award discharges its obligations\n       under the policy). When there is no \u201camount to be awarded in the\n       judgment to the claimant for the claimant\u2019s claim under the insurance\n       policy,\u201d the numerator of the fraction described by subsection (a)(3)(A)\n       does not exist\u2014which means the fraction\u2019s value is zero (or non-\n       existent). Multiplying this zero-value by another number, as required\n       in the calculation\u2019s second step, can never yield a non-zero amount of\n       attorney\u2019s fees. As a result, in this case and others like it, there will\n       never be a non-zero amount of permissible attorney\u2019s fees under the\n       formula described in section 542A.007(a)(3).\n\n                                         ....\n\n              As in Ortiz, in this case there is no further amount that Rodriguez\n       can recover in a \u201cjudgment to [Rodriguez] for [his] claim under the\n       insurance policy.\u201d TEX. INS. CODE \u00a7 542A.007(a)(3)(A) (emphasis\n       added). This is so because Safeco has discharged its liability under the\n       policy by paying the appraisal amount plus any possible statutory\n       interest. In other words, Safeco has \u201ccomplied with its obligations\n       under the policy,\u201d Ortiz, 589 S.W.3d at 133, so there is no remaining\n       \u201camount to be awarded in the judgment to the claimant for the\n       claimant\u2019s claim under the insurance policy,\u201d TEX. INS. CODE ANN. \u00a7\n       542A.007(a)(3)(A). As a result, no attorney\u2019s fees are available under\n       section 542A.007(a)(3)\u2019s formula.\n\nId. at 793\u201394. The Court concluded that \u201csection 542A.007 of the Insurance Code\n\nprohibits an award of attorney\u2019s fees when an insurer has fully discharged its\n\nobligations under the policy by voluntarily paying the appraised amount, plus any\n\nstatutory interest, in compliance with the policy\u2019s appraisal provisions.\u201d See id. at\n\n792.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\f      Simiarly, here, HAIC has discharged its liability under the policy by paying\n\nthe appraisal amount in full, along with statutory interest, and has complied with its\n\nobligations under the policy.           Under Texas       Insurance Code section\n\n542A.007(a)(3)(A) and Rodriguez, \u201cthere is no remaining amount to be awarded in\n\nthe judgment to [Menchaca] for [his] claim under the insurance policy.\u201d Id. at 794.\n\nConsequently,    Menchaca     cannot    recover   attorney\u2019s   fees   under   section\n\n542A.007(a)(3)\u2019s formula.\n\n      Menchaca, however, argues that the jury did not award attorney\u2019s fees to him\n\nas a result of any of his counterclaims but, rather, as a result of the declaratory\n\njudgment claim HAIC filed against him. This argument is unavailing. Contrary to\n\nMenchaca\u2019s assertion, Question 10 in the jury charge was not conditioned on an\n\nearlier finding but, instead, asked: \u201cWhat is a reasonable fee for the necessary\n\nservices of Defendant Menchaca\u2019s attorney in this case . . . [f]or the representation\n\nin the trial court[?]\u201d (Emphasis added). Similarly, the trial court\u2019s judgment states:\n\n\u201cMenchaca is entitled to recover . . . $250,000 to compensate Mr. Menchaca for the\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney\u2019s fees in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added). We\n\nfurther note that the declaration of one of Menchaca\u2019s attorneys in support of his\n\nrequest for attorney\u2019s fees that was admitted at trial states: \u201cI am familiar with the\n\ntime, billing and expenses incurred by the Buzbee Law Firm in the preparation and\n\nhandling of trial in the above-referenced matter. Based upon the hours spent\n\n\n                                         22\n\fmultiplied by the hourly rate of each lawyer involved, Mr. Menchaca has incurred\n\n$250,000.00 in attorney fees.\u201d (Emphasis added). There is nothing to suggest that\n\nthe jury awarded attorney\u2019s fees as a result of HAIC\u2019s declaratory judgment claim\n\nand not on his counterclaims.\n\n      Because HAIC has paid the full appraisal award and any possible statutory\n\ninterest, we hold that Menchaca cannot recover attorney\u2019s fees and the trial court\n\nerred in awarding him such. See Rodriguez, 684 SW.3d at 792.\n\n      We sustain HAIC\u2019s third issue.11\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We reverse the trial court\u2019s May 31, 2023 final judgment and render judgment\n\nthat Menchaca take nothing on his counterclaims against HAIC.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           Kristin M. Guiney\n                                                           Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Rivas-Molloy, Guiney, and Morgan.\n\n\n\n\n11\n      Having concluded that Texas Insurance Code section 542A.007 precludes any\n      recovery of attorney\u2019s fees, we need not address HAIC\u2019s additional argument that\n      Menchaca presented legally insufficient evidence to support his attorney\u2019s fees\n      claim.

Yet he was not represented by counsel here. He was not\n\ngiven opportunities to explain some of his statements. He has no way to appeal and\n\nclear his name, ever.\n\n         The findings were not needed to decide the issue that was before the trial\n\ncourt. That means they are not important for any issue on appeal, meaning this Court\n\nhas no authority to review them. How perverse that these findings\u2014which will\n\nimpact a police officer\u2019s career\u2014are unreviewable because they were needless.\n\nThat\u2019s why I take the unusual act of writing a concurring opinion to an opinion of\n\nthe Court I authored: Things ought to be said that cannot come from the voice of the\n\nCourt.\n\n         I will review the trial court\u2019s findings and show that they ought not have been\n\nmade, that one is unsupported by the record, and that the finding that Officer Wilson\n\nacted \u201cwith a reckless disregard for the truth\u201d is a misapplication of that term.\n\nIndeed, the rest of the trial court\u2019s findings prove the trial court believed his\n\ntestimony that his insignificant errors were honest mistakes.\n\n         If it were procedurally possible to declare these findings an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, I would urge the Court to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fThe findings were legally pointless.\n\n      Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) makes clear it does not authorize\n\nfree-ranging inquiries into the truthfulness of every statement in an affidavit. To just\n\nget a hearing, a defendant must make a substantial preliminary showing that\n\nstatements in the affidavit 1) are false, 2) are either \u201cdeliberate falsehood[s]\u201d or\n\nmade with \u201creckless disregard for the truth,\u201d and 3) are necessary to the probable\n\ncause finding. 438 U.S. at 171. Franks is explicit that even if a defendant shows an\n\naffiant lied, if, after removing those deliberate falsehoods, \u201cthere remains sufficient\n\ncontent in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is\n\nrequired.\u201d Id. at 172.\n\n      The State argued, repeatedly, that the allegations of falsehoods in the\n\nappellant\u2019s motions did not justify a Franks hearing because the affidavit contained\n\nprobable cause even without the supposedly false statements. After the Franks\n\nhearing, the trial court, Judge Natalia \u201cNata\u201d Cornelio, found that even without the\n\nsupposedly false statements the affidavit contained probable cause. The trial court\n\ncould have denied the appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing. Or she could have held\n\na hearing and denied the motion without additional findings about the falseness of\n\nthe statements or Officer Wilson\u2019s mental state in making them.\n\n      If an appellate opinion contained needless statements, other courts would\n\ndisregard them as obiter dicta\u2014something said in passing of no precedential value.\n\n\n                                           3\n\fBut the trial court\u2019s needless findings here, while not precedential, will follow\n\nOfficer Wilson.\n\nOne supposedly false statement in the affidavit is ambiguous, and the other two\nseem to be innocent drafting errors.\n\n      Defense counsel and the trial court focused particularly on one statement in\n\nthe affidavit: \u201cIn Cybertip 49956945, a representative of Dropbox, Inc., reported that\n\na Dropbox, Inc., user had uploaded approximately eight sexually explicit files which\n\ndepicted suspected child pornography to the Dropbox, Inc., servers on May 27,\n\n2019.\u201d The Cybertip, which was admitted at the hearing, showed an \u201cincident time\u201d\n\non May 27, but fine print under that information said the \u201cincident time\u201d was set to\n\n24 hours before Dropbox reported the incident. Upload logs admitted at the hearing\n\nshowed the files were actually uploaded in January 2018 and January 2019.\n\n      Defense counsel and the trial court treated it as obvious that the complained-of\n\nsentence says that the files were uploaded on May 27. But, as the State correctly\n\nargued, the sentence is ambiguous as to what happened on May 27. Consider the\n\nfollowing sentence:\n\n      Pete ate a pie Mary baked on May 27.\n\n      I think the most natural reading of that sentence is that Mary baked the pie on\n\nMay 27. But if Pete explained that on May 27 he ate a pie that Mary had baked the\n\nday before, I wouldn\u2019t call him a liar based on that sentence.\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      In the same way, the complained-of sentence in the affidavit is ambiguous as\n\nto whether Dropbox made a report on May 27, or whether the files were uploaded\n\non May 27. The most natural reading is that the files were uploaded on May 27, but\n\nthat\u2019s not the only plausible reading.\n\n      At the Franks hearing, Officer Wilson conceded the sentence was \u201cpoorly\n\nworded,\u201d but said he had meant to explain \u201c[the child pornography] was discovered\n\nor they put that offense date and time as May 27.\u201d Rather than accept Officer\n\nWilson\u2019s clarification\u2014which comports with the language of the sentence and the\n\nextraneous evidence\u2014the trial court found that the statement was false and made\n\nwith a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n      The second statement the trial court found false regarded IP addresses.\n\nAccording to the affidavit Dropbox reported two IP addresses that had logged into\n\nthe account: 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 and 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:\n\n34d4:994e:ca6a.\n\n      In the affidavit, Officer Wilson stated that another officer, Officer Corrales,\n\nsent a subpoena to Comcast \u201cfor the subscriber and billing information for IP\n\nAddresses 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 and 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:\n\n34d4:994e:ca6a on January 17, 2019 at 06:08:25 UTC and May 23, 2019 at 09:59:20\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fUTC, respectfully [sic].\u201d1 The affidavit then stated that Officer Wilson reviewed the\n\ninformation Officer Corrales got back from Comcast and it \u201cindicated that the\n\nsubscriber, service address, and billing address for IP Addresses 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:\n\n6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 and 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:34d4:994e:ca6a on said date\u201d\n\nwere assigned to a particular user.\n\n      At the Franks hearing, defense counsel introduced the subpoenaed\n\ninformation from Comcast, which connected IP address 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:\n\n34d4:994e:ca6a to the particular user on May 23, but which said the company had\n\nno records for who was using 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 on January\n\n17.\n\n      Officer Wilson explained that his statement in the affidavit that Comcast\n\nconnected both IP addresses to the particular user on both of the queried dates was\n\nan \u201coversight\u201d on his part. He was not asked how his oversight occurred. I will note\n\nthat each of those IP addresses contains 30 characters that don\u2019t spell words or form\n\ninherently meaningful combinations. In writing this opinion, to ensure consistency I\n\ntyped the IP addresses once and then used copy and paste for later uses. The record\n\ndoes not contain an explanation from Officer Wilson as to how this \u201coversight\u201d\n\n\n1\n      Writing or saying \u201crespectfully\u201d instead of \u201crespectively\u201d is a common and\n      well-known usage error that does not cause genuine confusion. See Compton v.\n      State, 148 S.W. 580, 581 (Tex. 1912) (where indictment alleged defendant stole\n      multiple items from multiple victims \u201crespectfully,\u201d \u201cthe word, \u2018respectively,\u2019 was\n      clearly meant and intended. No one could be misled by this.\u201d).\n\n                                           6\n\foccurred, but I suspect Officer Wilson simply copied and pasted a bit too much. The\n\nstatement in the affidavit that the Comcast records related to \u201csaid date,\u201d not \u201csaid\n\ndates\u201d supports this theory, and it supports Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony that he did\n\nnot intend to include the second date.\n\n      Regardless of the cause of the error, the circumstances do not suggest any\n\nintent to mislead. Officer Wilson admitted it was an error. The false information was\n\nredundant, and less persuasive than the true information: The true information in the\n\naffidavit pinned the Dropbox account to an IP address assigned to the appellant\u2019s\n\nresidence in May 2019, but the false information pinned the Dropbox account to an\n\nIP address assigned to the appellant\u2019s residence in January 2019, a more remote\n\nperiod. Moreover, pinning the Dropbox account to the appellant\u2019s IP address wasn\u2019t\n\neven needed for probable cause: It doesn\u2019t make more or less likely that child\n\npornography would be in the Dropbox account at the time of a prospective search.\n\n      The third statement the trial court found false regarded record preservation.\n\nAccording to one paragraph in the affidavit, Officer Wilson \u201cprovided notice to\n\nDropbox, Inc. to preserve the contents of the customer or individual subscriber/user\n\naccount\u201d associated the appellant\u2019s name and email address. At the Franks hearing,\n\nOfficer Wilson testified that while he normally makes such requests he did not do so\n\nhere because, as he stated elsewhere in the affidavit, he knew that Dropbox ordinarily\n\npreserved records for Cybertips without request.\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      Again, everything in the record strongly points at this being an honest error.\n\nThe false information was less persuasive than the true information\u2014if Dropbox\n\nordinarily preserves its records, that\u2019s better than an officer making a preservation\n\nrequest that might not be granted. No one asked Officer Wilson directly why this\n\nfalse information was in this affidavit, but Officer Wilson testified that in his five\n\nyears working child pornography cases he wrote between 20 and 45 warrant\n\naffidavits per month,2 and he used forms to draft warrants. When part of a form\n\nappears as an artifact in a document where it\u2019s inappropriate, that\u2019s lamentable and\n\nsomething everyone should try to avoid, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily bear on the\n\nintegrity of the drafter, particularly when the artifact doesn\u2019t further the purpose of\n\nthe document.\n\nThe errors in this affidavit do not show a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n      Franks is clear that even if an affidavit contains false statements that are\n\nnecessary to probable cause, exclusion is appropriate only if the statements were\n\ndeliberately false or made with a reckless disregard for the truth: \u201cAllegations of\n\nnegligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\u201d 438 U.S. at 171. That\u2019s because\n\nFranks\u2014a special application of the Mapp exclusionary rule\u2014is about deterring\n\npolice misconduct. Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135, 144\u201345 (2009)\n\n\n2\n      At the suppression hearing defense counsel was explicit he did not believe Officer\n      Wilson intended to deceive, but rather that his errors were due to being\n      \u201coverwork[ed].\u201d\n\n                                           8\n\f(discussing Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961) and Franks). \u201cTo trigger the\n\nexclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can\n\nmeaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the\n\nprice paid by the justice system.\u201d Id. at 144. Franks protects a defendant\u2019s right to\n\nan honest warrant affidavit; it does not create a right to a warrant affidavit free from\n\nhonest error.\n\n      The trial court did not explain why she thought the misstatements in this\n\naffidavit rose to the level of \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d She did not state she\n\nfound Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony not credible; indeed, several of her findings\n\nrequire believing Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony. The extent of her finding was:\n\n\u201cConsidering the totality of the circumstances, including the three false statements\n\nmade by Officer Wilson in his affidavit, the Court finds that the [sic] Officer Wilson\n\ndemonstrated a reckless disregard for the truth in his affidavit. Franks v. Delaware,\n\n438 U.S. 154 (1978).\u201d\n\n      Judge Cornelio\u2019s finding that Officer Wilson demonstrated a reckless\n\ndisregard for the truth doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. First, one of the \u201cfalse\u201d statements\n\nwasn\u2019t false at all but an ambiguous sentence the trial court interpreted uncharitably.\n\nAn ambiguous sentence is not \u201cfalse\u201d for Franks purposes. \u201c[Affidavits] must be\n\ninterpreted in a commonsense manner, neither held to the standard of what judges\n\nor lawyers feel they would have written if given the opportunity nor judged as an\n\n\n                                           9\n\fentry in an essay contest. Mere imprecision does not, by itself, show falsity.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Moody, 931 F.3d 366, 372 (4th Cir. 2019) (citations and quotations omitted)\n\n(rejecting Franks claim where complained-of sentence had multiple possible\n\nmeanings, one of which was false).\n\n      The other two false statements do not meet the standard for reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth. Franks\u2019s requirement that a defendant show the false statement was\n\nmade \u201cknowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth\u201d mirrors\n\nthe \u201cactual malice\u201d standard used in defamation cases, where a plaintiff must show\n\na false statement about a public official was made \u201cwith knowledge that it was false\n\nor with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d Nero v. Mosby, 890 F.3d\n\n106, 128 (4th Cir. 2018). Thus we use the common law definitions of \u201creckless\n\ndisregard for the truth\u201d and negligence found in constitutional contexts, rather than\n\nattaching out-of-context definitions from the Texas Penal Code.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court summarized its federal counterpart\u2019s descriptions\n\nof \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d in Bentley v. Bunton, 94 S.W.3d 561 (Tex. 2002).\n\nThe standard focuses on the subjective state of mind of the speaker. Id. at 591. It\n\nrequires more culpability than mere negligence; it \u201crequires that a [speaker] have,\n\nsubjectively, significant doubt about the truth of his statements at the time they are\n\nmade.\u201d Id. at 596.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Officer Wilson admitted the statements about the IP address and record\n\npreservations requests were false. That does not mean, however, he had significant\n\ndoubt about the truth of his statements at the time he made them. Rather, he testified\n\nthat he did not know he made the statements in the affidavit. He had no mental state\n\nregarding the statements, they were included in error. On the facts here that\u2019s \u201cmere\n\nnegligence or an innocent mistake\u201d that does not rise to the level of a Franks\n\nviolation.\n\n      Of course, the trial court was not required to believe Officer Wilson\u2019s version\n\nof events.

Yet he was not represented by counsel here. He was not\n\ngiven opportunities to explain some of his statements. He has no way to appeal and\n\nclear his name, ever.\n\n         The findings were not needed to decide the issue that was before the trial\n\ncourt. That means they are not important for any issue on appeal, meaning this Court\n\nhas no authority to review them. How perverse that these findings\u2014which will\n\nimpact a police officer\u2019s career\u2014are unreviewable because they were needless.\n\nThat\u2019s why I take the unusual act of writing a concurring opinion to an opinion of\n\nthe Court I authored: Things ought to be said that cannot come from the voice of the\n\nCourt.\n\n         I will review the trial court\u2019s findings and show that they ought not have been\n\nmade, that one is unsupported by the record, and that the finding that Officer Wilson\n\nacted \u201cwith a reckless disregard for the truth\u201d is a misapplication of that term.\n\nIndeed, the rest of the trial court\u2019s findings prove the trial court believed his\n\ntestimony that his insignificant errors were honest mistakes.\n\n         If it were procedurally possible to declare these findings an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, I would urge the Court to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fThe findings were legally pointless.\n\n      Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) makes clear it does not authorize\n\nfree-ranging inquiries into the truthfulness of every statement in an affidavit. To just\n\nget a hearing, a defendant must make a substantial preliminary showing that\n\nstatements in the affidavit 1) are false, 2) are either \u201cdeliberate falsehood[s]\u201d or\n\nmade with \u201creckless disregard for the truth,\u201d and 3) are necessary to the probable\n\ncause finding. 438 U.S. at 171. Franks is explicit that even if a defendant shows an\n\naffiant lied, if, after removing those deliberate falsehoods, \u201cthere remains sufficient\n\ncontent in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is\n\nrequired.\u201d Id. at 172.\n\n      The State argued, repeatedly, that the allegations of falsehoods in the\n\nappellant\u2019s motions did not justify a Franks hearing because the affidavit contained\n\nprobable cause even without the supposedly false statements. After the Franks\n\nhearing, the trial court, Judge Natalia \u201cNata\u201d Cornelio, found that even without the\n\nsupposedly false statements the affidavit contained probable cause. The trial court\n\ncould have denied the appellant\u2019s motion without a hearing. Or she could have held\n\na hearing and denied the motion without additional findings about the falseness of\n\nthe statements or Officer Wilson\u2019s mental state in making them.\n\n      If an appellate opinion contained needless statements, other courts would\n\ndisregard them as obiter dicta\u2014something said in passing of no precedential value.\n\n\n                                           3\n\fBut the trial court\u2019s needless findings here, while not precedential, will follow\n\nOfficer Wilson.\n\nOne supposedly false statement in the affidavit is ambiguous, and the other two\nseem to be innocent drafting errors.\n\n      Defense counsel and the trial court focused particularly on one statement in\n\nthe affidavit: \u201cIn Cybertip 49956945, a representative of Dropbox, Inc., reported that\n\na Dropbox, Inc., user had uploaded approximately eight sexually explicit files which\n\ndepicted suspected child pornography to the Dropbox, Inc., servers on May 27,\n\n2019.\u201d The Cybertip, which was admitted at the hearing, showed an \u201cincident time\u201d\n\non May 27, but fine print under that information said the \u201cincident time\u201d was set to\n\n24 hours before Dropbox reported the incident. Upload logs admitted at the hearing\n\nshowed the files were actually uploaded in January 2018 and January 2019.\n\n      Defense counsel and the trial court treated it as obvious that the complained-of\n\nsentence says that the files were uploaded on May 27. But, as the State correctly\n\nargued, the sentence is ambiguous as to what happened on May 27. Consider the\n\nfollowing sentence:\n\n      Pete ate a pie Mary baked on May 27.\n\n      I think the most natural reading of that sentence is that Mary baked the pie on\n\nMay 27. But if Pete explained that on May 27 he ate a pie that Mary had baked the\n\nday before, I wouldn\u2019t call him a liar based on that sentence.\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f      In the same way, the complained-of sentence in the affidavit is ambiguous as\n\nto whether Dropbox made a report on May 27, or whether the files were uploaded\n\non May 27. The most natural reading is that the files were uploaded on May 27, but\n\nthat\u2019s not the only plausible reading.\n\n      At the Franks hearing, Officer Wilson conceded the sentence was \u201cpoorly\n\nworded,\u201d but said he had meant to explain \u201c[the child pornography] was discovered\n\nor they put that offense date and time as May 27.\u201d Rather than accept Officer\n\nWilson\u2019s clarification\u2014which comports with the language of the sentence and the\n\nextraneous evidence\u2014the trial court found that the statement was false and made\n\nwith a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n      The second statement the trial court found false regarded IP addresses.\n\nAccording to the affidavit Dropbox reported two IP addresses that had logged into\n\nthe account: 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 and 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:\n\n34d4:994e:ca6a.\n\n      In the affidavit, Officer Wilson stated that another officer, Officer Corrales,\n\nsent a subpoena to Comcast \u201cfor the subscriber and billing information for IP\n\nAddresses 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 and 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:\n\n34d4:994e:ca6a on January 17, 2019 at 06:08:25 UTC and May 23, 2019 at 09:59:20\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fUTC, respectfully [sic].\u201d1 The affidavit then stated that Officer Wilson reviewed the\n\ninformation Officer Corrales got back from Comcast and it \u201cindicated that the\n\nsubscriber, service address, and billing address for IP Addresses 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:\n\n6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 and 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:34d4:994e:ca6a on said date\u201d\n\nwere assigned to a particular user.\n\n      At the Franks hearing, defense counsel introduced the subpoenaed\n\ninformation from Comcast, which connected IP address 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:115f:\n\n34d4:994e:ca6a to the particular user on May 23, but which said the company had\n\nno records for who was using 2601:2c1:c100:5d0:6c4f:605b:fc52:d2f3 on January\n\n17.\n\n      Officer Wilson explained that his statement in the affidavit that Comcast\n\nconnected both IP addresses to the particular user on both of the queried dates was\n\nan \u201coversight\u201d on his part. He was not asked how his oversight occurred. I will note\n\nthat each of those IP addresses contains 30 characters that don\u2019t spell words or form\n\ninherently meaningful combinations. In writing this opinion, to ensure consistency I\n\ntyped the IP addresses once and then used copy and paste for later uses. The record\n\ndoes not contain an explanation from Officer Wilson as to how this \u201coversight\u201d\n\n\n1\n      Writing or saying \u201crespectfully\u201d instead of \u201crespectively\u201d is a common and\n      well-known usage error that does not cause genuine confusion. See Compton v.\n      State, 148 S.W. 580, 581 (Tex. 1912) (where indictment alleged defendant stole\n      multiple items from multiple victims \u201crespectfully,\u201d \u201cthe word, \u2018respectively,\u2019 was\n      clearly meant and intended. No one could be misled by this.\u201d).\n\n                                           6\n\foccurred, but I suspect Officer Wilson simply copied and pasted a bit too much. The\n\nstatement in the affidavit that the Comcast records related to \u201csaid date,\u201d not \u201csaid\n\ndates\u201d supports this theory, and it supports Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony that he did\n\nnot intend to include the second date.\n\n      Regardless of the cause of the error, the circumstances do not suggest any\n\nintent to mislead. Officer Wilson admitted it was an error. The false information was\n\nredundant, and less persuasive than the true information: The true information in the\n\naffidavit pinned the Dropbox account to an IP address assigned to the appellant\u2019s\n\nresidence in May 2019, but the false information pinned the Dropbox account to an\n\nIP address assigned to the appellant\u2019s residence in January 2019, a more remote\n\nperiod. Moreover, pinning the Dropbox account to the appellant\u2019s IP address wasn\u2019t\n\neven needed for probable cause: It doesn\u2019t make more or less likely that child\n\npornography would be in the Dropbox account at the time of a prospective search.\n\n      The third statement the trial court found false regarded record preservation.\n\nAccording to one paragraph in the affidavit, Officer Wilson \u201cprovided notice to\n\nDropbox, Inc. to preserve the contents of the customer or individual subscriber/user\n\naccount\u201d associated the appellant\u2019s name and email address. At the Franks hearing,\n\nOfficer Wilson testified that while he normally makes such requests he did not do so\n\nhere because, as he stated elsewhere in the affidavit, he knew that Dropbox ordinarily\n\npreserved records for Cybertips without request.\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      Again, everything in the record strongly points at this being an honest error.\n\nThe false information was less persuasive than the true information\u2014if Dropbox\n\nordinarily preserves its records, that\u2019s better than an officer making a preservation\n\nrequest that might not be granted. No one asked Officer Wilson directly why this\n\nfalse information was in this affidavit, but Officer Wilson testified that in his five\n\nyears working child pornography cases he wrote between 20 and 45 warrant\n\naffidavits per month,2 and he used forms to draft warrants. When part of a form\n\nappears as an artifact in a document where it\u2019s inappropriate, that\u2019s lamentable and\n\nsomething everyone should try to avoid, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily bear on the\n\nintegrity of the drafter, particularly when the artifact doesn\u2019t further the purpose of\n\nthe document.\n\nThe errors in this affidavit do not show a reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n      Franks is clear that even if an affidavit contains false statements that are\n\nnecessary to probable cause, exclusion is appropriate only if the statements were\n\ndeliberately false or made with a reckless disregard for the truth: \u201cAllegations of\n\nnegligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\u201d 438 U.S. at 171. That\u2019s because\n\nFranks\u2014a special application of the Mapp exclusionary rule\u2014is about deterring\n\npolice misconduct. Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135, 144\u201345 (2009)\n\n\n2\n      At the suppression hearing defense counsel was explicit he did not believe Officer\n      Wilson intended to deceive, but rather that his errors were due to being\n      \u201coverwork[ed].\u201d\n\n                                           8\n\f(discussing Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961) and Franks). \u201cTo trigger the\n\nexclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can\n\nmeaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the\n\nprice paid by the justice system.\u201d Id. at 144. Franks protects a defendant\u2019s right to\n\nan honest warrant affidavit; it does not create a right to a warrant affidavit free from\n\nhonest error.\n\n      The trial court did not explain why she thought the misstatements in this\n\naffidavit rose to the level of \u201creckless disregard for the truth.\u201d She did not state she\n\nfound Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony not credible; indeed, several of her findings\n\nrequire believing Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony. The extent of her finding was:\n\n\u201cConsidering the totality of the circumstances, including the three false statements\n\nmade by Officer Wilson in his affidavit, the Court finds that the [sic] Officer Wilson\n\ndemonstrated a reckless disregard for the truth in his affidavit. Franks v. Delaware,\n\n438 U.S. 154 (1978).\u201d\n\n      Judge Cornelio\u2019s finding that Officer Wilson demonstrated a reckless\n\ndisregard for the truth doesn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. First, one of the \u201cfalse\u201d statements\n\nwasn\u2019t false at all but an ambiguous sentence the trial court interpreted uncharitably.\n\nAn ambiguous sentence is not \u201cfalse\u201d for Franks purposes. \u201c[Affidavits] must be\n\ninterpreted in a commonsense manner, neither held to the standard of what judges\n\nor lawyers feel they would have written if given the opportunity nor judged as an\n\n\n                                           9\n\fentry in an essay contest. Mere imprecision does not, by itself, show falsity.\u201d United\n\nStates v. Moody, 931 F.3d 366, 372 (4th Cir. 2019) (citations and quotations omitted)\n\n(rejecting Franks claim where complained-of sentence had multiple possible\n\nmeanings, one of which was false).\n\n      The other two false statements do not meet the standard for reckless disregard\n\nfor the truth. Franks\u2019s requirement that a defendant show the false statement was\n\nmade \u201cknowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth\u201d mirrors\n\nthe \u201cactual malice\u201d standard used in defamation cases, where a plaintiff must show\n\na false statement about a public official was made \u201cwith knowledge that it was false\n\nor with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d Nero v. Mosby, 890 F.3d\n\n106, 128 (4th Cir. 2018). Thus we use the common law definitions of \u201creckless\n\ndisregard for the truth\u201d and negligence found in constitutional contexts, rather than\n\nattaching out-of-context definitions from the Texas Penal Code.\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court summarized its federal counterpart\u2019s descriptions\n\nof \u201creckless disregard for the truth\u201d in Bentley v. Bunton, 94 S.W.3d 561 (Tex. 2002).\n\nThe standard focuses on the subjective state of mind of the speaker. Id. at 591. It\n\nrequires more culpability than mere negligence; it \u201crequires that a [speaker] have,\n\nsubjectively, significant doubt about the truth of his statements at the time they are\n\nmade.\u201d Id. at 596.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Officer Wilson admitted the statements about the IP address and record\n\npreservations requests were false. That does not mean, however, he had significant\n\ndoubt about the truth of his statements at the time he made them. Rather, he testified\n\nthat he did not know he made the statements in the affidavit. He had no mental state\n\nregarding the statements, they were included in error. On the facts here that\u2019s \u201cmere\n\nnegligence or an innocent mistake\u201d that does not rise to the level of a Franks\n\nviolation.\n\n      Of course, the trial court was not required to believe Officer Wilson\u2019s version\n\nof events. See id. (\u201cself-serving protestations of sincerity\u201d do not automatically\n\ndefeat claim of reckless disregard). But we know from her findings that she believed\n\nhim on this point; if she did not believe him, she would have found the false\n\nstatements were made intentionally.3 Her finding that the statements were made\n\nrecklessly means she found Officer Wilson\u2019s testimony credible, she just applied the\n\nwrong legal standard to the fact she found.\n\n      The affidavit here was eleven pages. If that\u2019s typical for Officer Wilson\u2019s\n\nwork\u2014and it looks typical for this sort of case\u2014at between 20 and 45 affidavits per\n\nmonth Officer Wilson was producing thousands of pages of writing per year, and I\n\n\n\n3\n      At the conclusion of her oral findings, the trial court said she \u201chope[d]\u201d that \u201cin\n      future warrants Officer Wilson is more careful and thorough with the\n      representations that he makes.\u201d That comment is appropriate in response to\n      accidental misstatements, not intentional falsehoods.\n\n                                          11\n\fdoubt he had a support staff helping him edit. With that sort of volume there will be\n\nerrors. But so long as they are honest errors, they ought not result in unreviewable\n\ncareer-damaging credibility findings.\n\n      In fairness to the trial court, the definition of \u201creckless disregard\u201d is seldom\n\nlitigated in a detailed manner. But the lack of directly on-point caselaw should weigh\n\nagainst making needless findings.\n\n      Indeed, the Franks framework, if followed, should not create unreviewable\n\nfindings. Franks is a narrow exception to the ordinary rule against attacking facially\n\nvalid warrants. That\u2019s why it requires such a substantial evidentiary showing to get\n\na hearing.

THD S.p.A. filed a special appearance and argued that it\n\nsold its medical devices to an Iowa company, THD America, Inc., which\n\nindependently determined where to sell and distribute those devices. In response, the\n\nPeggs pointed to THD S.p.A.\u2019s \u201cDistribution Quality Agreement\u201d with THD America\n\nand other evidence they contend demonstrated THD S.p.A.\u2019s intent and purpose to\n\nserve the Texas market. The trial court denied THD S.p.A.\u2019s special appearance, and it\n\nappealed.\n\n      In their opening briefs, both parties argued about another stream-of-commerce\n\nspecial-appearance case that was then pending before the Texas Supreme Court\n\ninvolving a foreign manufacturer that also sold its products to a third-party distributor\n\nthat then sold the products to Texas customers. See BRP-Rotax GmbH & Co. KG v.\n\nShaik, No. 23-0756, 2025 WL 1727903 (Tex. June 20, 2025). THD S.p.A. urged us to\n\nawait the supreme court\u2019s decision before deciding this appeal, which we have done.\n\nWe hold\u2014in line with BRP-Rotax\u2014that because the Peggs did not establish that\n\nTHD S.p.A. purposefully availed itself of the Texas market\u2014as contrasted with and\n\ndistinct from THD America\u2019s conduct\u2014the trial court erred by denying THD S.p.A.\u2019s\n\nspecial appearance. We will reverse.\n\n                                           2\n\f                   I. Background Facts and Procedural History\n\n      When 58-year-old Jeffry Pegg developed Grade III internal hemorrhoids, his\n\nprimary care physician referred him to surgeon Dr. Jennifer Lowney. Dr. Lowney and\n\nJeffry discussed various treatment options, and Dr. Lowney recommended the \u201cTHD\n\nprocedure,\u201d which she allegedly said \u201cwas less invasive and had less down time than\n\nthe hemorrhoidectomy procedure.\u201d According to Jeffry, Dr. Lowney did not discuss\n\nany risks or complications other than possibly having to repeat the procedure or do a\n\nfull hemorrhoidectomy if the THD procedure was unsuccessful.\n\n      Jeffry had the THD procedure. Immediately afterward, Dr. Lowney reported\n\nthat Jeffry\u2019s hemorrhoids \u201cwere successfully treated,\u201d but unfortunately, Jeffry\u2019s bowel\n\nhad been perforated during the surgery, and he began to develop many problems.\n\nTwo days after the surgery, Jeffry went to the emergency room and was admitted to\n\nthe ICU. He had severe sepsis, pain, and organ failure. Jeffry needed additional\n\nsurgeries, including an ileostomy surgery. He developed additional complications,\n\nincluding abdominal pain, a hernia at the colostomy site, and acute pulmonary\n\nembolisms requiring hospitalization.\n\n      Jeffry and his wife, Jennifer, sued Dr. Lowney and others for medical\n\nmalpractice.1 Additionally, the Peggs asserted various product-liability claims against\n\nTHD S.p.A.\u2014an Italian corporation\u2014and THD America\u2014an Iowa-based\n\n      The Peggs later nonsuited their claims against Dr. Lowney and other named\n      1\n\ndefendants, leaving pending their claims against THD America and THD S.p.A.\n\n\n                                           3\n\fcorporation\u2014concerning the THD device and procedure. The Peggs alleged that\u2014\n\nalthough headquartered in Italy\u2014THD S.p.A. did \u201cbusiness in the State of Texas by\n\nselling and distributing THD medical devices through a worldwide chain of\n\ndistribution, including selling and distributing THD medical devices including but not\n\nlimited to the THD Slide One Kit for sale in the State of Texas.\u201d\n\n       THD America answered, but THD S.p.A. filed a special appearance denying\n\nthe Peggs\u2019 jurisdictional allegations:\n\n       THD S.p.A. never sold or distributed any devices in Texas or the United\n       States. In fact, THD S.p.A. does not conduct business in America, as any\n       American business is conducted solely by the THD American entity,\n       THD America, Inc.\u2014whom [the Peggs] have also named as a\n       [d]efendant and whom [the Peggs] acknowledge is organized under\n       American laws.\n\nTHD S.p.A. argued that THD America had independently performed all the conduct\n\nthat the Peggs alleged as the basis for personal jurisdiction. THD S.p.A. thus argued\n\nthat because no nexus existed among THD S.p.A., the Peggs\u2019 causes of action, and\n\nTexas, the trial court should not exercise personal jurisdiction over THD S.p.A.\n\n       According to the Peggs, both THD entities\u2014who were jointly represented by\n\nthe same counsel\u2014inadequately responded to the Peggs\u2019 jurisdictional-discovery\n\nefforts. But after filing several motions to compel, the Peggs eventually obtained\n\ndocuments and deposed Anne Wegner, THD America\u2019s corporate representative and\n\nits Director of Finance. We will discuss the Peggs\u2019 evidence responsive to the special\n\nappearance in greater detail below, but they presented the following: (1) excerpts from\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fWegner\u2019s oral deposition; (2) portions of THD America\u2019s discovery responses; (3) a\n\ntranscript of a hearing on one of the Peggs\u2019 motions to compel; (4) THD America\u2019s\n\n\u201cOrg Chart\u201d; (5) marketing materials concerning the THD Doppler\u00ae Hemorrhoid\n\nSystem, the THD Slide One Kit, and the THD Doppler procedure; (6) the\n\ndistribution agreement; and (7) documents on file with the Food and Drug\n\nAdministration (FDA) concerning THD S.p.A.\u2019s 2008 premarket regulatory filings\n\nand THD S.p.A.\u2019s Italian facility in March of 2013. 2\n\n      At the special-appearance hearing, the trial court considered the evidence,\n\nheard both sides\u2019 arguments, verbally confirmed the Peggs\u2019 allegations that THD\n\nS.p.A.\u2019s Slide One Kit had been used in Texas during Jeffry\u2019s hemorrhoid surgery and\n\nhad allegedly caused the Peggs\u2019 damages, and then denied the special appearance. This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n\n      THD S.p.A. raises two issues: (1) it lacked sufficient minimum contacts with\n\nTexas and did not purposefully avail itself of the Texas market to justify the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over it; and (2) the trial court\u2019s\n\nexercise of such jurisdiction did not comport with traditional notions of fair play and\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        In reply, THD S.p.A. provided a complete copy of Wegner\u2019s deposition\ntranscript, copies of additional regulatory communications, and portions of the Peggs\u2019\nwritten discovery and the responses to it.\n\n\n                                           5\n\fsubstantial justice. Agreeing with THD S.p.A. on its first issue, we conclude that the\n\ntrial court erred by denying THD S.p.A.\u2019s special appearance.\n\nA. Standard of review and applicable law\n\n      Because a trial court\u2019s authority to exercise personal jurisdiction over a\n\nnonresident defendant is a legal question, we review de novo a trial court\u2019s decision to\n\ngrant or deny a special appearance. See State v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft, 669 S.W.3d\n\n399, 413 (Tex. 2023); Am. Type Culture Collection, Inc. v. Coleman, 83 S.W.3d 801, 805\u2013\n\n06 (Tex. 2002). When, as here, the trial court does not issue findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, we presume that all factual disputes were resolved in favor of the\n\ntrial court\u2019s decision unless they are challenged on appeal. Luciano v.\n\nSprayFoamPolymers.com, LLC, 625 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. 2021).\n\n      A Texas court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident if \u201c(1) the\n\nTexas long-arm statute authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction, and (2) the exercise of\n\njurisdiction is consistent with federal and state constitutional due-process guarantees.\u201d\n\nMoki Mac River Expeditions v. Drugg, 221 S.W.3d 569, 574 (Tex. 2007); see also Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 17.041\u2013.045. The Texas long-arm statute broadly permits\n\njurisdiction over a nonresident doing \u201cbusiness in this state\u201d if the nonresident\n\n\u201ccontracts . . . with a Texas resident and either party is to perform the contract in\n\nwhole or in part in [Texas]\u201d or \u201ccommits a tort in whole or in part in [Texas].\u201d Tex.\n\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 17.042(1), (2). But this list is not exclusive, and the\n\nstatute\u2019s \u201cbroad language extends Texas courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction \u2018as far as the\n\n                                            6\n\ffederal constitutional requirements of due process will permit.\u2019\u201d BMC Software Belg.\n\nN.V. v. Marchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 795 (Tex. 2002) (quoting U-Anchor Advert., Inc. v.\n\nBurt, 553 S.W.2d 760, 762 (Tex. 1977)).\n\n      In determining whether federal-due-process requirements have been met, we\n\nrely on precedent from the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts as\n\nwell as Texas state-court decisions. BMC Software, 83 S.W.3d at 795; TravelJungle v. Am.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 212 S.W.3d 841, 845\u201346 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2006, no pet.). Federal\n\ndue process is satisfied when (1) the defendant has established minimum contacts\n\nwith the state and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of\n\nfair play and substantial justice. BNSF Ry. Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.S. 402, 413, 137 S. Ct.\n\n1549, 1558 (2017); TV Azteca v. Ruiz, 490 S.W.3d 29, 36 (Tex. 2016).\n\n      A defendant establishes minimum contacts with a state when it \u201cpurposefully\n\navails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus\n\ninvoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d Retamco Operating, Inc. v. Republic\n\nDrilling Co., 278 S.W.3d 333, 338 (Tex. 2009) (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235,\n\n253, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 1240 (1958)). Three principles govern our purposeful-availment\n\nanalysis: (1) only the defendant\u2019s contacts with Texas are relevant, not the unilateral\n\nactivity of another party or third persons; (2) the defendant\u2019s acts must be purposeful\n\nand not random, isolated, or fortuitous; and (3) the defendant must seek some benefit,\n\nadvantage, or profit by availing itself of Texas\u2019s jurisdiction so that it impliedly\n\nconsents to suit here. M & F Worldwide Corp. v. Pepsi-Cola Metro. Bottling Co.,\n\n                                           7\n\f512 S.W.3d 878, 886 (Tex. 2017) (citing Michiana Easy Livin\u2019 Country, Inc. v. Holten,\n\n168 S.W.3d 777, 785 (Tex. 2005)). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s activities, whether they consist of\n\ndirect acts within Texas or conduct outside Texas, must justify a conclusion that the\n\ndefendant could reasonably anticipate being called into a Texas court.\u201d Retamco,\n\n278 S.W.3d at 338 (quoting Am. Type Culture Collection, 83 S.W.3d at 806).\n\n       A defendant\u2019s contacts can give rise to general or specific jurisdiction, see\n\nMoncrief Oil Int\u2019l Inc. v. OAO Gazprom, 414 S.W.3d 142, 150 (Tex. 2013), but the Peggs\n\ndid not rely on general jurisdiction in the trial court and do not argue it on appeal.\n\nAccordingly, we need address only the parties\u2019 specific-jurisdiction arguments.\n\nSpecific jurisdiction exists when the cause of action arises from or is related to a\n\ndefendant\u2019s purposeful activities in the state. Id. \u201cFor a Texas court to exercise\n\nspecific jurisdiction over a defendant, \u2018(1) the defendant\u2019s contact with Texas must be\n\npurposeful, and (2) the cause of action must arise from those contacts.\u2019\u201d Old Republic\n\nNat\u2019l Title Ins. Co. v. Bell, 549 S.W.3d 550, 559 (Tex. 2018) (quoting Michiana,\n\n168 S.W.3d at 795). When analyzing specific jurisdiction, our focus is on the\n\nrelationship among Texas, the defendant, and the litigation. Moncrief Oil, 414 S.W.3d at\n\n150.\n\nB. The stream-of-commerce-plus test in product-liability cases\n\n       In product-liability cases, \u201c[t]he stream-of-commerce doctrine is a useful tool to\n\nconceptualize minimum contacts.\u201d Luciano, 625 S.W.3d at 9. \u201cIts utility derives from\n\nthe recognition that specific jurisdiction over nonresident manufacturers is often\n\n                                           8\n\fpremised on \u2018indirect\u2019 sales by independent distributors or agents.\u201d Id. \u201cBut a seller\u2019s\n\nawareness that the stream of commerce may or will sweep the product into the forum\n\nstate does not convert the mere act of placing the product in the stream into an act\n\npurposefully directed toward the forum state.\u201d Id. at 9\u201210 (cleaned up).\n\n      Instead, \u201cTexas courts require additional conduct evincing an intent or purpose\n\nto serve the market in the forum state, whether directly or indirectly.\u201d Id. at\n\n10 (cleaned up). \u201cEvidence of such additional conduct may include advertising in the\n\nforum state; soliciting business through salespersons; or creating, controlling, or\n\nemploying the distribution system that brought the product into the forum state.\u201d Id.\n\n(cleaned up). This additional conduct is known as the \u201cplus factor.\u201d In re Christianson\n\nAir Conditioning & Plumbing, LLC, 639 S.W.3d 671, 679 (Tex. 2022) (orig. proceeding).\n\n      With this extant framework, the Texas Supreme Court \u201cbr[oke] no new\n\njurisprudential ground\u201d in deciding BRP-Rotax, 2025 WL 1727903, at *1, and\n\n\u201cfaithfully applie[d] the law of personal jurisdiction to the facts of th[e] case,\u201d id. at\n\n*10 (Busby, J., concurring). Its decision\u2014applying the stream-of-commerce-plus test\n\nto a fact pattern similar to the case at hand\u2014reiterated the standard for when a Texas\n\ncourt may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a foreign company whose\n\nproducts are sold or delivered to the Texas market: the \u201ctest requires a defendant to\n\nspecifically target Texas; it is not enough that a defendant may foresee some of its\n\nproducts\u2019 eventually arriving here.\u201d Id. at *1; see also Luciano, 625 S.W.3d at 9\u201310.\n\nIndeed, such \u201ctargeting\u201d must be shown beyond \u201cmerely passive awareness of a\n\n                                            9\n\flikelihood\u2014even a substantial likelihood verging on certainty\u2014that products may\n\neventually arrive in our State.\u201d BRP-Rotax, 2025 WL 1727903, at *5. Applying this test,\n\nthe court held that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that Rotax (a foreign\n\nengine manufacturer) had so targeted Texas based on evidence that it had executed\n\ndistribution agreements with independent distributors that controlled and were\n\nresponsible for the distribution system that brought Rotax\u2019s engines to Texas. Id. at\n\n*9\u201310.\n\nC. The parties\u2019 shifting burdens of proof\n\n         The plaintiff and the defendant bear shifting burdens of proof in a challenge to\n\npersonal jurisdiction. Kelly v. Gen. Interior Constr., Inc., 301 S.W.3d 653, 658 (Tex. 2010).\n\nThe plaintiff must first plead sufficient allegations to bring the nonresident defendant\n\nwithin the reach of Texas\u2019s long-arm statute. Id. \u201cTo determine whether the plaintiff\n\nsatisfied its pleading burden and to determine the basis for jurisdiction alleged by the\n\nplaintiff, a court considers the allegations in the plaintiff\u2019s petition as well as those in\n\nits response to the defendant\u2019s special appearance.\u201d Graves v. DJO, LLC, 636 S.W.3d\n\n321, 325 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2021, pet. denied) (op. on reh\u2019g) (citing Am.\n\nRefrigeration Co. v. Tranter, Inc., No. 02-15-00265-CV, 2016 WL 5957018, at *3 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Fort Worth Oct. 13, 2016, no pet.) (mem. op.)).\n\n         Once the plaintiff has met this burden, the burden generally shifts to the\n\ndefendant to negate all alleged bases of personal jurisdiction. Id. A defendant can\n\nnegate jurisdiction on either a legal or factual basis:\n\n                                             10\n\f      Factually, the defendant can present evidence that it has no contacts with\n      Texas, effectively disproving the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. The plaintiff can\n      then respond with its own evidence that affirms its allegations, and it\n      risks dismissal of its lawsuit if it cannot present the trial court with\n      evidence establishing personal jurisdiction. Legally, the defendant can\n      show that even if the plaintiff\u2019s alleged facts are true, the evidence is\n      legally insufficient to establish jurisdiction; the defendant\u2019s contacts with\n      Texas fall short of purposeful availment; for specific jurisdiction, that the\n      claims do not arise from the contacts; or that traditional notions of fair\n      play and substantial justice are offended by the exercise of jurisdiction.\n\nKelly, 301 S.W.3d at 659 (footnotes omitted).\n\nD. Analysis\n\n      In its appellate brief, THD S.p.A. does not dispute that the Peggs met their\n\ninitial pleading burden; instead, it contends that the evidence failed to demonstrate\n\nthat THD S.p.A. had sufficient minimum contacts to support personal jurisdiction in\n\nTexas. We thus focus only on the legal sufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence.3 See\n\nid. at 658; Graves, 636 S.W.3d at 325.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        Ordinarily we consider the trial court\u2019s exercise of specific jurisdiction on a\nclaim-by-claim basis, but because the Peggs\u2019 product-liability claims against THD\nS.p.A. (for negligence; strict liability by design, manufacturing, and marketing defects;\nand breach of the implied warranty of merchantability) all arise from the same alleged\nforum contacts (the Peggs allege their damages were caused by Jeffry\u2019s THD\nprocedure), we consider the claims together. See M & F Worldwide, 512 S.W.3d at\n886 (citing Moncrief Oil, 414 S.W.3d at 150).\n\n\n                                           11\n\f   1. The special-appearance evidence\n\n       a. THD S.P.A.\u2019s evidence\n\n       As part of THD S.p.A.\u2019s special appearance, CEO Filippo Bastia verified the\n\nfollowing factual allegations that THD S.p.A. argued negated the Peggs\u2019 personal-\n\njurisdiction allegations:\n\n       THD S.p.A. is a foreign (Italian) corporation.\n\n       [It] has never done business in Texas.\n\n       [It] has never entered into contracts in Texas, nor entered into any\n       contracts that were due to be performed substantially in Texas.\n\n       [It] does not and never has maintained a regular place of business in\n       Texas.\n\n       [It] is not required to, and does not have, a designated agent for service\n       of process in Texas.\n\n       [It] does not have, and has never had, an address or telephone number in\n       Texas.\n\n       [It] has never owned, leased, rented, or controlled any real property in\n       Texas.\n\n       [It] does not now have, and has never had, employees in Texas.\n\n       [It] has never paid taxes in Texas.\n\n       b. The Peggs\u2019 evidence\n\n       We summarize as follows the pertinent evidence the Peggs filed in response to\n\nTHD S.P.A.\u2019s special appearance, including excerpts from Wegner\u2019s deposition, the\n\ndistribution agreement, marketing materials, and regulatory communications:\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f\u2022 THD S.p.A. is an Italian corporation that manufactures various medical\n  devices, including the THD Slide One Kit.\n\n\u2022 Federal regulatory documents confirm that THD S.p.A. is located in Correggio,\n  Italy and in 2008 engaged a Massachusetts-based regulatory consultant to act as\n  its regulatory contact person for its premarket regulatory filings. In 2013, the\n  FDA issued a warning letter to THD S.p.A. about its Italian-located operations.\n\n\u2022 THD America is an Iowa-based corporation that sells THD S.p.A.\u2019s medical\n  devices in the United States under a distribution agreement with THD S.p.A.\n  The distribution agreement defines each party\u2019s obligations \u201cto ensure that\n  [THD S.p.A.\u2019s] products . . . are imported, sold and distributed in the United\n  States market.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Under the distribution agreement, THD America serves as THD S.p.A.\u2019s\n  United States agent, initial importer, and distributor for THD S.p.A.\u2019s\n  products\u2014the medical devices and accessories that THD S.p.A. sells to THD\n  America. THD S.p.A. is solely responsible for ensuring that product labeling is\n  compliant with all \u201cUS applicable law\u201d and for all product modifications. THD\n  S.p.A. also maintains the right to audit THD America\u2019s facilities. In addition,\n  the distribution agreement requires other actions on THD S.p.A.\u2019s behalf,\n  including specifying how THD America (1) stores and documents THD\n  S.p.A.\u2019s products and (2) communicates about investigations, complaints, and\n  compliance issues so that THD S.p.A. can \u201cevaluate the most appropriate\n  action and/or remedy to be taken.\u201d\n\n\u2022 After buying THD S.p.A.\u2019s products, THD America sells them to its\n  customers, typically hospitals, doctors, and surgery centers, including those in\n  Texas. THD S.p.A. creates and provides the marketing materials for THD\n  America to provide its customers. The product-data sheet for the THD Slide\n  One Kit (the device at issue in this case) includes THD S.p.A.\u2019s Italian address,\n  Italian phone and fax numbers, and website (www.thdlab.com).\n\n\u2022 THD America has 12 salespeople\u2014two of whom are specifically assigned to\n  sales in one of two Texas markets (north and south)\u2014who report to its\n  national sales and marketing director, who in turn reports to its board of\n  directors.\n\n\u2022 THD America provides THD S.p.A. with daily sales reports broken down by\n  salesperson. Wegner initially testified that this is so THD S.p.A. \u201ccan get a\n  pulse on the demand for the products\u201d and knows how many devices to make\n\n                                      13\n\f      and ship to THD America, but she twice clarified that she does not work for\n      THD S.p.A. and said she \u201cha[s] no idea what they\u2019re using them for\u201d and had\n      based her testimony on \u201can assumption.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 The various THD companies (including THD America and THD S.p.A.) are\n     owned by the same ownership group. But THD America is not a subsidiary of\n     THD S.p.A., and THD S.p.A. has no ownership interest in THD America.\n\n   \u2022 THD America\u2019s board of directors includes Bastia and Giulliano Spaggiari.\n     Bastia is also the President of THD S.p.A., and Spaggiari is also the Chief\n     Strategy Officer of \u201call of the\u201d THD companies, including THD S.p.A. and\n     THD America.\n\n   \u2022 Bastia signed the distribution agreement for THD S.p.A. in his capacity as its\n     CEO; Spaggiari signed the agreement for THD America in his capacity as its\n     Director.\n\n   2. Application of law to fact\n\n      We analyze this evidence to determine whether the Peggs demonstrated that\n\nTHD S.p.A. specifically targeted Texas. See BRP-Rotax, 2025 WL 1727903, at *5. The\n\nPeggs focus on three categories of evidence to argue THD S.p.A.\u2019s alleged Texas\n\ntargeting: (1) the distribution agreement and marketing materials; (2) THD S.p.A.\u2019s\n\nreceipt and use of THD America\u2019s daily sales reports; and (3) the allegedly \u201cshare[d]\n\ncommon ownership, common officers, and common board members\u201d between THD\n\nAmerica and THD S.p.A. Whether considered individually or collectively, the\n\nevidence is legally insufficient to show that THD S.p.A. targeted Texas.\n\n      a. The distribution agreement and marketing materials\n\n      The Peggs contend that THD S.p.A. targeted Texas through a distribution\n\nsystem with THD America that it controlled to bring its medical devices into Texas.\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fThey point out that THD S.p.A. manufactures medical devices for sale around the\n\nworld and throughout the United States. For sales in the United States, THD S.p.A.\n\nhas signed a distribution agreement with exclusive distributor THD America. The\n\nPeggs maintain that \u201cTHD S.p.A. controls facets of how THD America markets,\n\nlabels, and distributes THD S.p.A.\u2019s products.\u201d And they argue that the distribution\n\nagreement and marketing materials that THD S.p.A. provided to THD America,\n\nincluding its Texas salespeople, demonstrate that THD S.p.A. targeted Texas.\n\n      But the distribution agreement says nothing about Texas. Rather, it focuses on\n\nthe entire \u201cUnited States market.\u201d Moreover, none of the distribution agreement\u2019s\n\nprovisions\u2014such as those concerning product labeling, storage, and recalls\u2014have\n\nanything to do with targeting the Texas market. Similarly, none of the marketing\n\nmaterials in the record focus on or target Texas doctors, hospitals, or patients.\n\nFurthermore, none of the regulatory filings and communications between the FDA\n\nand THD S.p.A. mention Texas or any specific contacts with Texas.\n\n      In short, the distribution system at issue is distinguishable from those in which\n\nforeign manufacturers have specifically targeted Texas through their distribution\n\nagreements and marketing materials. See BRP-Rotax, 2025 WL 1727903, at *7 (first\n\nciting Spir Star AG v. Kimich, 310 S.W.3d 868, 874 (Tex. 2010); then citing Siskind v.\n\nVilla Found. for Educ., Inc., 642 S.W.2d 434, 436\u201337 (Tex. 1982); and then citing\n\nMichiana, 168 S.W.3d at 785). Unlike the distribution-system evidence in these three\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\flisted cases, but similar to that in BRP-Rotax, THD S.p.A.\u2019s distribution agreement and\n\nmarketing materials are aimed at a broad, non-Texas-specific territory. See id. at *5.\n\n      In BRP-Rotax, the supreme court noted that \u201cthere [wa]s no evidence that\n\nRotax specifically targeted Texas at all,\u201d see id. at *8, which is the same situation as\n\nhere. Because \u201cit is only the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum that count,\u201d the Peggs\n\ncannot rely on evidence of THD America\u2019s conduct targeting the Texas market. See id.\n\nat *6 (cleaned up). THD America sold one or more of THD S.p.A.\u2019s medical devices\n\nto a Texas customer, but THD S.p.A.\u2019s\u201c[t]argeting Texas [is] the touchstone\u201d for our\n\nspecific personal jurisdictional analysis, and we will not \u201cfind targeting that does not\n\nexist merely because [THD S.p.A.\u2019s devices] ultimately c[ame] to Texas.\u201d Id. at *7.\n\nHere, the Peggs failed to prove that THD S.p.A. created, controlled, or employed a\n\ndistribution system through its distribution agreement and marketing materials that\n\nbrought its medical devices into Texas. See id. at *4; Luciano, 625 S.W.3d at 10.\n\n      b. THD S.p.A.\u2019s knowledge of THD America\u2019s sales in Texas\n\n      The Peggs next argue that the evidence shows THD S.p.A.\u2019s targeting Texas\n\nbased on Wegner\u2019s testimony that THD America has a specific sales force, including\n\ntwo Texas-focused salespeople, to distribute THD S.p.A.\u2019s medical devices to\n\nhospitals, doctors, and surgery centers in Texas. They also point to Wegner\u2019s\n\ntestimony about THD S.p.A.\u2019s receiving daily sales reports from THD America,\n\narguing that THD S.p.A. receives this information so that it can project how many\n\ndevices to make and ship to THD America. The Peggs contend that \u201cTHD S.p.A.\n\n                                           16\n\fexpects its products to reach\u201d Texas \u201chospitals, doctors, and surgery centers\u201d and\n\nuses THD America\u2019s daily sales reports, including from THD America\u2019s Texas-\n\nfocused salespeople, to know how many devices to make and ship to THD America.\n\n       Setting aside the fact that Wegner also testified that she did not work for THD\n\nS.p.A., \u201cha[d] no idea what they\u2019re using [the daily sales reports] for,\u201d and was basing\n\nher testimony on \u201can assumption,\u201d none of her testimony shows that THD S.p.A.\u2014\n\nas compared with THD America\u2014was targeting Texas. See BRP-Rotax,\n\n2025 WL 1727903, at *6. Rather, it shows that THD S.p.A. was aware that THD\n\nAmerica was selling THD S.p.A.\u2019s devices in Texas. See id. at *5 (stating that\n\nawareness is insufficient).\n\n       But even were we to take at face value Wegner\u2019s statement that THD S.p.A.\n\nused the sales reports to \u201cget a pulse on the demand for the products,\u201d such evidence\n\ndid not demonstrate that THD S.p.A. was specifically targeting Texas as compared to\n\nthe United States market as a whole. Notably, the Peggs presented no evidence of\n\nTHD America\u2019s sales in Texas in terms of revenue generated or numbers of devices\n\nsold. See, e.g., LG Chem, Ltd. v. Turner, No. 14-19-00326-CV, 2021 WL 2154075, at\n\n*5 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] May 27, 2021, no pet.) (mem. op.). Nor did they\n\nshow what percentage of THD America\u2019s revenues were derived from Texas\n\ncustomers as compared to the broader United States market or any evidence that\n\nTHD S.p.A. used the sales reports or similar sales data to then market or target\n\nspecific devices for sale in Texas. See id. At best, the evidence showed that THD\n\n                                          17\n\fAmerica generally kept THD S.p.A. informed about what products THD America\n\nwas selling so that THD S.p.A. could make more of those products to supply to THD\n\nAmerica.\n\n      Ultimately, THD S.p.A.\u2019s \u201cmere awareness, or foreseeability, of [their medical\n\ndevices\u2019] sale or distribution in Texas alone cannot create minimum contacts sufficient\n\nto support personal jurisdiction.\u201d BRP-Rotax, 2025 WL 1727903, at *4 (cleaned up); see\n\nalso Hyundam Indus. Co. v. Swacina, No. 24-0207, 2025 WL 1717010, at *5 (Tex. June\n\n20, 2025) (\u201c[E]vidence of Hyundai\u2019s Elantra sales is legally insufficient to show that\n\nHyundam targeted Texas. We do not consider the unilateral activity of Hyundai, a\n\nthird party, in assessing Hyundam\u2019s contacts with Texas.\u201d). Accordingly, Wegner\u2019s\n\ntestimony about THD S.p.A.\u2019s awareness of THD America\u2019s daily sales reports did\n\nnot constitute evidence of THD S.p.A.\u2019s purposeful availment of the privilege of\n\nconducting business activities in Texas.\n\n      c. Alleged common ownership, officers and board members\n\n      Finally, the Peggs generally assert that \u201cTHD S.p.A. and THD America share\n\ncommon ownership, common officers, and common board members.\u201d When\n\nquestioned about THD\u2019s \u201cOrg Chart,\u201d Wegner confirmed that several individuals,\n\nsuch as Bastia and Spaggiari, hold leadership roles in both companies. But as we have\n\ndetailed, the evidence does not show that THD S.p.A. actually owns or controls THD\n\nAmerica. Wegner testified that they were \u201clike sister companies,\u201d but she\n\n\n\n                                           18\n\funequivocally testified that (1) THD America is not a subsidiary of THD S.p.A. and\n\n(2) THD S.p.A. has no ownership interest in THD America.\n\n      Despite broadly asserting alleged common ownership and leaders, the Peggs\n\npoint to no evidence and make no accompanying argument that THD America is the\n\nalter ego of THD S.p.A. or supporting any other theory of jurisdictional veil-piercing\n\nto impute THD America\u2019s contacts with Texas to THD S.p.A. See PHC-Minden, L.P.\n\nv. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 235 S.W.3d 163, 172\u201376 (Tex. 2007); Cimiano v. Halberstam,\n\nNo. 02-23-00127-CV, 2024 WL 2970847, at *9\u201311 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth June 13,\n\n2024, no pet.) (mem. op.). Texas law presumes that THD S.p.A. and THD America\n\nare separate legal persons, and the Peggs have presented no evidence to the contrary.\n\nSee PHC-Minden, L.P., 235 S.W.3d at 173; Cimiano, 2024 WL 2970847, at *9. Because\n\nno evidence shows the sort of control that is required to \u201cfuse\u201d them together or to\n\notherwise treat them as one entity, THD America\u2019s contacts with Texas cannot be\n\nimputed to THD S.p.A. based on THD America\u2019s \u201cOrg Chart\u201d or Wegner\u2019s\n\ntestimony that they are \u201clike sister companies\u201d and share common leadership. See\n\nPHC-Minden, L.P., 235 S.W.3d at 175\u201376; Cimiano, 2024 WL 2970847, at *11. Such\n\nevidence thus failed to show that THD S.p.A. targeted Texas.\n\n      In sum, because the Peggs\u2019 special-appearance evidence concerning the\n\ndistribution agreement, marketing materials, regulatory communications, THD\n\nS.p.A.\u2019s awareness of THD America\u2019s sales, and their common leadership failed to\n\ndemonstrate that THD S.p.A. specifically targeted and thus purposefully availed itself\n\n                                         19\n\fof the Texas market, we cannot conclude that THD S.p.A. was subject to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s exercise of specific jurisdiction. See BRP-Rotax, 2025 WL 1727903, at *1, *9\u2013\n\n10; Luciano, 625 S.W.3d at 8. Accordingly, based on the unique evidentiary record\n\nbefore the trial court, see LG Chem Am., Inc. v. Morgan, 670 S.W.3d 341, 350 (Tex.\n\n2023), the trial court erred by denying THD S.p.A.\u2019s special appearance. We sustain\n\nTHD S.p.A.\u2019s first issue.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n      Having sustained THD S.p.A.\u2019s first issue, 4 we reverse the trial court\u2019s order\n\ndenying THD S.p.A.\u2019s special appearance and render judgment dismissing the Peggs\u2019\n\nclaims against THD S.p.A. for want of personal jurisdiction. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n43.2(c); Gordon & Doner, P.A. v. Joros, 287 S.W.3d 325, 336 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth\n\n2009, no pet.).\n\n\n\n                                                      /s/ Elizabeth Kerr\n                                                      Elizabeth Kerr\n                                                      Justice\n\nDelivered: July 31, 2025\n\n\n      4\n       Because we have concluded that sufficient minimum contacts were not present\nfor a Texas court to assert personal jurisdiction over THD S.p.A., we need not\naddress its second issue concerning whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nwould offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

(\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251         Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,\n        867, 872 (1994); and then quoting Campbell-McCormick, Inc. v. Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway.

We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614. But four years later, Congress enacted CAFA, and with it the provision for review\n\n        codified at \u00a7 1453(c). Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L.

We need not resolve the matter in this case because\n        Defendants did not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u2014which was filed within thirty days of\n        removal, as calculated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C)\u2014was untimely.\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        4, 12\u201313 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)). So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

Here, Plaintiffs invoked the local-\n\n        controversy exception.\n\n               \u201cThe elements of the local controversy exception are as follows: (1) more than two-\n\n        thirds of the members of the proposed plaintiff class are citizens of the state where the suit\n\n        was filed originally; (2) at least one defendant (a) is a defendant from whom members of\n\n        the plaintiff class are seeking \u2018significant relief,\u2019 (b) is a defendant whose conduct \u2018forms\n\n        a significant basis\u2019 for the proposed plaintiff class\u2019s claims, and (c) is a citizen of the state\n\n        in which the action originally was filed; (3) the principal injuries stemming from the\n\n        conduct alleged in the complaint occurred in the state where the action was filed originally;\n\n        and (4) in the three years before the filing of the class action complaint, no other similar\n\n        class action was filed against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other class.\u201d\n\n        Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 964 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)).\n\n               The parties agree that the third and fourth elements are satisfied here, but they\n\n        dispute the first and second. The district court found all elements satisfied and granted\n\n        Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand. We agree with the district court and therefore affirm.\n\n                                                       A.\n\n               Before turning to the two disputed elements, we address the question of Plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden. \u201cUnder CAFA, the removing party bears the burden of establishing federal\n\n        jurisdiction over a class action, but the party seeking remand has the burden of proving that\n\n        one of CAFA\u2019s three exceptions to removal applies.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u2013\n\n\n                                                       19\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 20 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        36. And we have held that the burden on the removing party is \u201cto prove [that] CAFA\n\n        jurisdiction exists by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d at 195. But we have\n\n        not specified the standard by which the party seeking remand must carry its burden to show\n\n        that an exception applies. 10 E.g., Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u201336; Bartels ex rel.\n\n        Bartels v.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v. Chesapeake Operating, LLC, 718 F. App\u2019x 736, 739 n.3 (10th Cir.\n\n        2018) (quoting Dutcher, 840 F.3d at 1190).\n\n                We agree. CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n        (\u201cAbsent specific language in the statute specifying a different evidentiary standard, we\n\n        employ [for purposes of the local-controversy exception] the time-honored standard\n\n        routinely applied to the fundamental question of citizenship: proof by a preponderance of\n\n        the evidence.\u201d).\n\n               We therefore join our peer circuits in concluding that parties seeking remand must\n\n        show that a CAFA exception applies by a preponderance of the evidence. 12\n\n\n               12\n                  We recognize that, where no evidence has been submitted and the matter is to be\n        decided solely on the pleadings\u2014as with the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d element discussed\n        below, see infra Part III.C\u2014the language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is an ill fit.\n        For this reason, in the related context of the removing party\u2019s burden to establish CAFA\n        jurisdiction in the first place, the First Circuit has instead used the language of \u201creasonable\n        probability,\u201d while emphasizing that the standard is \u201cfor all practical purposes identical to\n        the preponderance standard adopted by several circuits.\u201d Amoche v. Guarantee Tr. Life Ins.\n\n\n                                                      22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 23 of 42\n\n\n\n\n                                                      B.\n\n               The first element of the local-controversy exception that Plaintiffs must establish by\n\n        a preponderance of the evidence is that \u201cgreater than two-thirds of the members of all\n\n        proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of\u201d Maryland. 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(I). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not carried their burden on this\n\n\n\n\n        Co., 556 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cThere was no error in the district court\u2019s discussion\n        of [the defendant]\u2019s burden in terms of the preponderance of the evidence. Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251        Doc: 88        Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area.

Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v.

The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses.

See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state.

See S.\n        Rep.

See\n\n        Mason, 842 F.3d at 390\u201391.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland.

United\n\n        States, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 350, 353 (1874))).\n\n               Accordingly, we conclude that the district court correctly determined that Plaintiffs\n\n        satisfied their burden on the citizenship element.\n\n                                                     C.\n\n               The local-controversy exception also requires Plaintiffs to demonstrate that \u201cat least\n\n        1 defendant is a defendant\u201d (a) \u201cfrom whom significant relief is sought by members of the\n\n        plaintiff class,\u201d (b) \u201cwhose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted\n\n        by the proposed plaintiff class,\u201d and (c) \u201cwho is a citizen of\u201d Maryland. 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II). We have previously labeled this \u201cthe \u2018at least 1 defendant\u2019 rule.\u201d\n\n        Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 964. Because TTI is the only Maryland-citizen defendant,\n\n        Plaintiffs must satisfy this element as to TTI to be able to invoke the local-controversy\n\n        exception. We conclude that they have done so.\n\n\n                                                     33\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 34 of 42\n\n\n\n\n               This Court has only considered the meaning of the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d rule\n\n        once, in our 2013 opinion in Quicken Loans Inc. v. Alig, 737 F.3d 960. However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Wal-Mart\n\n        Puerto Rico, Inc., 121 F.4th 228 (1st Cir. 2024) (per curiam), is instructive. Kress Stores\n\n        noted that the circuits \u201chave largely followed the . . .

As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17. But we agree with the First Circuit\u2019s rejection of that analysis in Kress\n\n        Stores, where it held that \u201cCAFA\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018a significant basis\u2019 requires a\n\n        comparative analysis to determine whether the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is \u2018an\n\n        important ground for the asserted claims in view of the alleged conduct of all the\n\n\n                                                      36\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 37 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Defendants.\u2019 But it does not follow that the test must be superlative, as the requirement of\n\n        a plus-factor would have it.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at\n\n        157). Such an interpretation \u201cwould rewrite \u2018a significant basis\u2019 in the statute into \u2018the most\n\n        significant basis.\u2019\u201d Id.; accord Walsh v. Defs., Inc., 894 F.3d 583, 592 (3d Cir. 2018)\n\n        (\u201c[T]he local controversy exception does not require that the local defendant\u2019s conduct be\n\n        the most significant conduct or that it predominates over claims against other defendants.\u201d).\n\n               Notably, in describing another exception (the home-state exception), CAFA uses a\n\n        different term absent from the local-controversy exception: it refers to \u201cthe primary\n\n        defendants.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(B) (emphasis added). While not an absolute rule,\n\n        there is a \u201cgenerally useful . . . interpretive principle\u201d of statutory construction that \u201c[i]n a\n\n        given statute, the same term usually has the same meaning and different terms usually have\n\n        different meanings.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 149 (2024). Because the local-\n\n        controversy exception requires only that the local defendant be \u201csignificant,\u201d while the\n\n        home-state exception refers to \u201cthe primary defendants,\u201d a review of the statute as a whole\n\n        supports that the local-controversy does not require that the local defendant be\n\n        superlatively \u201cprimary,\u201d but merely \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n               Our interpretation is also supported by the CAFA Senate Report, \u201cwhich contains\n\n        the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s views with respect to CAFA jurisdiction,\u201d and on which\n\n        \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court and our Court have heretofore had occasion to rely.\u201d Dominion\n\n        Energy, 928 F.3d at 336 n.11 (collecting cases). The Report states that \u201cthere must be at\n\n        least one real local defendant. By that, the Committee intends that the local defendant must\n\n        be a primary focus of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u2014not just a peripheral defendant. The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf.

By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient.

Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting.

Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id.

Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356. We agree:\n\n        nothing in the statute indicates that, if there is even a single claim not asserted against the\n\n        local defendant, the local-controversy exception does not apply.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal\n\n        under \u00a7 1291. We dismiss Defendants\u2019 petitions for review under \u00a7 1453 as unnecessary.\n\n        And we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the local-controversy exception applies\n\n\n                                                      41\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1251      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 42 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        and that remand to the state court is required.\n\n                                                                 AFFIRMED; PETITIONS FOR\n                                                                       REVIEW DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42"

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250         Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,\n        867, 872 (1994); and then quoting Campbell-McCormick, Inc. v. Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway. Accord\n\n        Cheapside Mins., Ltd. v. Devon Energy Prod. Co., 94 F.4th 492, 496 (5th Cir. 2024)\n\n        (\u201c[Section] 1447(d) does not trump \u00a7 1291 to deny appeal of a remand order based on the\n\n        local controversy exception[.]\u201d); Simring, 29 F.4th at 1265\u201366 (11th Cir.); Jacks v.\n\n        Meridian Res. Co., 701 F.3d 1224, 1229 (8th Cir. 2012), abrogated in part on other\n\n        grounds by BP P.L.C. v. Mayor of Balt., 593 U.S. 230 (2021); 16 Wright & Miller\u2019s Federal\n\n        Practice & Procedure \u00a7 3931.2 (3d ed. 2012 & Supp. 2025).\n\n                                                     C.\n\n               That leaves the question of whether \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeal\n\n        here, precluding Defendants from utilizing \u00a7 1291 even though they otherwise would be\n\n        entitled to do so. We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614. But four years later, Congress enacted CAFA, and with it the provision for review\n\n        codified at \u00a7 1453(c). Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, \u00a7 5, 119 Stat.\n\n\n        \u201creasonable time\u201d rule for remand motions where \u00a7 1447(c) does not apply. Watson, 821\n        F.3d at 640 (collecting cases). We need not resolve the matter in this case because\n        Defendants did not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u2014which was filed within thirty days of\n        removal, as calculated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C)\u2014was untimely.\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        4, 12\u201313 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)). So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2. This Court, along with all other circuits to have considered the issue, has adopted\n        the latter interpretation. Scott, 865 F.3d at 193 n.2; accord Romulus v.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

But we have\n\n        not specified the standard by which the party seeking remand must carry its burden to show\n\n        that an exception applies. 10 E.g., Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u201336; Bartels ex rel.\n\n        Bartels v.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v.

CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v.

Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250        Doc: 88        Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property. J.A. 101. She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 776 n.10 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting general principle that\n        \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view\u201d (quoting United States v.

She counted businesses as citizens only if they\n\n        were \u201ceither organized under Maryland law or had [their] principal place of business in\n\n        Maryland.\u201d Id. The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v. Express Check\n\n        Advance of SC LLC, 591 F.3d 698, 701\u201305 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1),\n\n        (d)(10)). This is the exact definition Greeley averred she used in searching the business-\n\n        entity class members on Maryland\u2019s websites. See J.A. 101 (\u201cIf a 4000 Foot Property owner\n\n\n               14\n                  CAFA thus alters the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d for diversity jurisdiction, under which \u201ca\n        limited liability company\u2019s \u2018citizenship is that of its members.\u2019\u201d Ferrell v.

Certainly, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s\n\n        implicit conclusion that this definition satisfied Plaintiffs\u2019 preponderance-based burden.\n\n                                                      2.\n\n               That leaves the more complicated question of the individual property owners. While\n\n        CAFA defines the term \u201ccitizen\u201d for corporations and unincorporated associations, it\n\n        provides no definition for individuals. We therefore will presume, for purposes of this\n\n\n                                                      26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250        Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025       Pg: 27 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        analysis, that \u201ccitizen\u201d carries the same meaning for the local-controversy exception under\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A) as it does for diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a). See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state. Such a presumption\n\n        does not undermine CAFA\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d of \u201ckeep[ing] interstate actions in federal court and\n\n        truly intrastate actions in the state courts.\u201d 15 Adams, 958 F.3d at 1223 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n               15\n                  In fact, the CAFA Senate Report suggests that Congress anticipated that residency\n        alone could be enough to support application of the local-controversy exception.

We further note that some other circuits have signaled\n\n        openness to this line of reasoning. 16 See Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 571, 573\u201374 (5th Cir.)\n\n        (stating that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s place of residence . . . is prima facie proof of his\n\n        domicile\u201d and that \u201cwhere a proposed class is discrete in nature, a common sense\n\n        presumption should be utilized in determining whether citizenship requirements have been\n\n        met,\u201d and citing favorably a district court decision concluding that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 assertions\n\n        that they represented a class of individuals covered by homeowner\u2019s policies for homes\n\n\n               16\n                  We also recognize that some other circuits disagree.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

Because TTI is the only Maryland-citizen defendant,\n\n        Plaintiffs must satisfy this element as to TTI to be able to invoke the local-controversy\n\n        exception. We conclude that they have done so.\n\n\n                                                     33\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 34 of 42\n\n\n\n\n               This Court has only considered the meaning of the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d rule\n\n        once, in our 2013 opinion in Quicken Loans Inc. v. Alig, 737 F.3d 960. However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17.

The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157\n\n        (vacating district court decision where local defendant sold 13% of all policies in the state,\n\n        not because 13% was insufficient, but because not all policies sold necessarily violated the\n\n        law, and therefore the district court\u2019s calculation had not properly focused on the alleged\n\n        conduct). By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient. Lemy v. Direct\n\n        Gen. Fin. Co., 559 F. App\u2019x 796, 798 & n.1 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting. See Goldberg, 2024 WL 1050942, at *15 (district\n\n        court concluding that \u201cif Plaintiffs meet their burdens as to Counts I and II, TTI\u2019s liability\n\n        could meet (or exceed) that of Skyline\u201d).\n\n               The Ninth Circuit provided helpful analysis in a similar case, Allen v. Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250       Doc: 88         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356. We agree:\n\n        nothing in the statute indicates that, if there is even a single claim not asserted against the\n\n        local defendant, the local-controversy exception does not apply.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal\n\n        under \u00a7 1291. We dismiss Defendants\u2019 petitions for review under \u00a7 1453 as unnecessary.\n\n        And we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the local-controversy exception applies\n\n\n                                                      41\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-1250      Doc: 88          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 42 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        and that remand to the state court is required.\n\n                                                                 AFFIRMED; PETITIONS FOR\n                                                                       REVIEW DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42"

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141        Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,\n        867, 872 (1994); and then quoting Campbell-McCormick, Inc. v. Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway.

We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614.

So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

That being so, we have no need to review their\n\n        petitions for permission to appeal, and we dismiss those petitions as unnecessary.\n\n                                                    III.\n\n               Having satisfied ourselves of our appellate jurisdiction, we turn to the merits and\n\n        consider whether the district court erred when it held that it was required to remand the\n\n        case to state court pursuant to CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception.

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

And we have held that the burden on the removing party is \u201cto prove [that] CAFA\n\n        jurisdiction exists by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d at 195. But we have\n\n        not specified the standard by which the party seeking remand must carry its burden to show\n\n        that an exception applies. 10 E.g., Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 335\u201336; Bartels ex rel.\n\n        Bartels v.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v. Chesapeake Operating, LLC, 718 F. App\u2019x 736, 739 n.3 (10th Cir.\n\n        2018) (quoting Dutcher, 840 F.3d at 1190).\n\n                We agree. CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141       Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v. Tenet Healthsystem Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc., 485 F.3d 804, 814 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n        (\u201cAbsent specific language in the statute specifying a different evidentiary standard, we\n\n        employ [for purposes of the local-controversy exception] the time-honored standard\n\n        routinely applied to the fundamental question of citizenship: proof by a preponderance of\n\n        the evidence.\u201d).\n\n               We therefore join our peer circuits in concluding that parties seeking remand must\n\n        show that a CAFA exception applies by a preponderance of the evidence. 12\n\n\n               12\n                  We recognize that, where no evidence has been submitted and the matter is to be\n        decided solely on the pleadings\u2014as with the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d element discussed\n        below, see infra Part III.C\u2014the language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d is an ill fit.\n        For this reason, in the related context of the removing party\u2019s burden to establish CAFA\n        jurisdiction in the first place, the First Circuit has instead used the language of \u201creasonable\n        probability,\u201d while emphasizing that the standard is \u201cfor all practical purposes identical to\n        the preponderance standard adopted by several circuits.\u201d Amoche v. Guarantee Tr. Life Ins.\n\n\n                                                      22\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 23 of 42\n\n\n\n\n                                                      B.\n\n               The first element of the local-controversy exception that Plaintiffs must establish by\n\n        a preponderance of the evidence is that \u201cgreater than two-thirds of the members of all\n\n        proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of\u201d Maryland. 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(I). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not carried their burden on this\n\n\n\n\n        Co., 556 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u201cThere was no error in the district court\u2019s discussion\n        of [the defendant]\u2019s burden in terms of the preponderance of the evidence. Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property.

She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 776 n.10 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting general principle that\n        \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view\u201d (quoting United States v.

The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v.

See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state.

See\n\n        Mason, 842 F.3d at 390\u201391.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Wal-Mart\n\n        Puerto Rico, Inc., 121 F.4th 228 (1st Cir. 2024) (per curiam), is instructive. Kress Stores\n\n        noted that the circuits \u201chave largely followed the . . .

Co., 561 F.3d 144, 156 (3d Cir. 2009)); see id.\n\n        at 239 n.6 (collecting cases). As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17. But we agree with the First Circuit\u2019s rejection of that analysis in Kress\n\n        Stores, where it held that \u201cCAFA\u2019s use of the phrase \u2018a significant basis\u2019 requires a\n\n        comparative analysis to determine whether the defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is \u2018an\n\n        important ground for the asserted claims in view of the alleged conduct of all the\n\n\n                                                      36\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141       Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 37 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Defendants.\u2019 But it does not follow that the test must be superlative, as the requirement of\n\n        a plus-factor would have it.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at\n\n        157). Such an interpretation \u201cwould rewrite \u2018a significant basis\u2019 in the statute into \u2018the most\n\n        significant basis.\u2019\u201d Id.; accord Walsh v. Defs., Inc., 894 F.3d 583, 592 (3d Cir. 2018)\n\n        (\u201c[T]he local controversy exception does not require that the local defendant\u2019s conduct be\n\n        the most significant conduct or that it predominates over claims against other defendants.\u201d).\n\n               Notably, in describing another exception (the home-state exception), CAFA uses a\n\n        different term absent from the local-controversy exception: it refers to \u201cthe primary\n\n        defendants.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(B) (emphasis added). While not an absolute rule,\n\n        there is a \u201cgenerally useful . . . interpretive principle\u201d of statutory construction that \u201c[i]n a\n\n        given statute, the same term usually has the same meaning and different terms usually have\n\n        different meanings.\u201d Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 149 (2024). Because the local-\n\n        controversy exception requires only that the local defendant be \u201csignificant,\u201d while the\n\n        home-state exception refers to \u201cthe primary defendants,\u201d a review of the statute as a whole\n\n        supports that the local-controversy does not require that the local defendant be\n\n        superlatively \u201cprimary,\u201d but merely \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n               Our interpretation is also supported by the CAFA Senate Report, \u201cwhich contains\n\n        the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s views with respect to CAFA jurisdiction,\u201d and on which\n\n        \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court and our Court have heretofore had occasion to rely.\u201d Dominion\n\n        Energy, 928 F.3d at 336 n.11 (collecting cases). The Report states that \u201cthere must be at\n\n        least one real local defendant. By that, the Committee intends that the local defendant must\n\n        be a primary focus of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u2014not just a peripheral defendant. The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf.

By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient.

Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting.

Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-141      Doc: 92          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356.

(\u201cSkyline\u201d) and Television\n\n        Tower, Inc. (\u201cTTI\u201d) sought review of the district court\u2019s remand order, which was based\n\n        on the Class Action Fairness Act\u2019s local-controversy exception. Defendants filed both a\n\n        petition for permission to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 and a regular notice of appeal\n\n        under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\n\n               Consistent with the three other circuits that have considered this issue, we conclude\n\n        that \u00a7 1291 provides a valid basis for appellate review here and, therefore, we dismiss the\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitions for permission to appeal as unnecessary.\n\n               On the merits, we affirm the district court\u2019s application of the local-controversy\n\n        exception and its remand to state court.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                                         A.\n\n               The allegations in the complaint are as follows. TTI, a Maryland corporation, owns\n\n        a 1,300-foot-tall TV tower in Baltimore. \u201cA total of 2.5 tons of [red] lead-based paint was\n\n        applied to the TV Tower during its construction\u201d in 1959, and TTI has known for decades\n\n        that the tower was covered in lead-based paint. J.A. 12. 1 TTI also knew that the paint would\n\n        deteriorate over time, as it has, including chipping and peeling.\n\n               Recently, \u201cTTI contracted with Skyline\u201d (a Colorado corporation with its principal\n\n        place of business in Nebraska) to clean the TV tower using high-pressure water, a process\n\n\n\n\n               1\n                   Citations to the \u201cJ.A.\u201d refer to the Joint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal.\n\n                                                         5\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142        Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 6 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        known as hydroblasting. J.A. 13. TTI and Skyline knew that hydroblasting would dislodge\n\n        and disperse the lead paint in a manner that \u201cwas inherently reckless and dangerous,\n\n        presenting a high risk of harm to the public.\u201d J.A. 13\u201314. Yet TTI failed to verify that\n\n        Skyline was appropriately accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work\u2014which, it\n\n        turns out, it was not. Nor did Defendants obtain the appropriate permit or notify the\n\n        Maryland Department of the Environment before undertaking the work.\n\n               Nevertheless, under TTI\u2019s direction, Skyline began hydroblasting the tower on May\n\n        28, 2022, a project that continued through August 17, 2022. 2 The hydroblasting activity\n\n        \u201cdislodged lead-based paint chips and paint dust\u201d from the tower. J.A. 15. The paint chips\n\n        and dust were \u201ccarried by gravity, thermal dynamics and wind away from the TV Tower\n\n        onto other real property,\u201d spreading \u201cfor at least 4000 feet in every direction.\u201d Id.\n\n               The eight named plaintiffs and others found red paint chips throughout the\n\n        community, including at a grocery store. 3 Their properties each \u201ctested positive for the\n\n        presence of lead paint chips and dust\u201d between November 2022 and February 2023. J.A.\n\n        15\u201316. Plaintiffs are concerned about their health and that of their neighbors (due to the\n\n        hazards posed by lead paint, especially for children), their property values (as they must\n\n        now disclose the lead exposure to any potential buyers), and the costs of remediation.\n\n                                                       B.\n\n               In May 2023, Plaintiffs filed a putative class action against TTI and Skyline in\n\n\n               2\n                   Ultimately, municipal authorities issued a stop-work order due to the lack of proper\n        permits.\n               3\n                  The Maryland Department of the Environment reported that, as of June 22, 2022,\n        thirty-five residents had reported finding lead paint chips on their properties.\n\n                                                        6\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 7 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland state court. They defined the class as \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the date\n\n        on which hydroblasting began. J.A. 21. They asserted claims for negligence against TTI\n\n        (count I) and Skyline (count II); negligent hiring, retention, and supervision against TTI\n\n        (count III); and strict liability for an abnormally dangerous activity against both Defendants\n\n        (count IV). They sought compensatory and punitive damages, plus injunctive relief in the\n\n        form of remediation.\n\n               In June 2023, Defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to the Class\n\n        Action Fairness Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d). Plaintiffs quickly moved to remand the action pursuant to\n\n        CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception. The district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in\n\n        March 2024. Goldberg v. Skyline Tower Painting Inc., No. 1:23-cv-01708, 2024 WL\n\n        1050942, at *16 (D. Md. Mar. 10, 2024).\n\n               Defendants each filed petitions for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s decision\n\n        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453. The following day, each Defendant also filed a notice of\n\n        appeal as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We consolidated the four cases and entered an\n\n        order deferring consideration of the petitions for permission to appeal pending formal\n\n        briefing.\n\n                                                     II.\n\n               Before we can reach the merits of the district court\u2019s remand order, we must\n\n        determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal at all. Defendants sought\n\n        appellate review through two channels: as of right under \u00a7 1291, and by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. We conclude that Defendants appropriately appealed as of right under \u00a7 1291, and\n\n\n                                                      7\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 8 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        therefore we need not consider whether we would grant permission to appeal under\n\n        \u00a7 1453. 4\n\n                                                      A.\n\n               We begin with an overview of the relevant statutory landscape.\n\n               The mine run of appeals that come before us are brought pursuant to notices of\n\n        appeal filed under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and invoke 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,\n\n        which gives us \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts\u201d within\n\n        this Circuit. 5 Id. In civil cases invoking our \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction, the appellant must timely\n\n        file the notice of appeal for us to properly exercise appellate jurisdiction. See Bowles v.\n\n        Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).\n\n               Our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291 is, however, limited by certain other provisions.\n\n        Relevant here is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to\n\n        the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d unless\n\n        it was removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442 (which relates to suits against federal officers)\n\n\n               4\n                  Plaintiffs did not challenge Defendants\u2019 right to appeal under \u00a7 1291 in their\n        response brief, instead raising an argument on this point for the first time at oral argument.\n        However, because the question implicates this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must\n        evaluate the issue despite any forfeiture. See Palmer v. City Nat\u2019l Bank, of W. Va., 498 F.3d\n        236, 240 (4th Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhether at the suggestion of the parties or otherwise, this Court\n        has an obligation to verify the existence of appellate jurisdiction before considering the\n        merits of an appeal.\u201d).\n                5\n                  Some non-final decisions may also be appealed under \u00a7 1291 pursuant to the\n        collateral order doctrine, \u201ca \u2018practical construction\u2019 of \u00a7 1291\u2019s \u2018final decision rule,\u2019 under\n        which a \u2018small class\u2019 of decisions that do not end the litigation on the merits may still\n        qualify for appellate review.\u201d Dubon v. Jaddou, 109 F.4th 307, 311 (4th Cir. 2024)\n        (citations omitted) (first quoting Digit. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863,\n        867, 872 (1994); and then quoting Campbell-McCormick, Inc. v. Oliver, 874 F.3d 390, 395\n        (4th Cir. 2017)).\n\n                                                      8\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 9 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        or \u00a7 1443 (which relates to civil-rights cases). Still, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed\n\n        under the \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed [as final judgments] pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n        \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., 239 F.3d 611, 614 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\n\n        added).\n\n               We also receive some appeals through other statutory channels. Relevant here, in\n\n        certain circumstances \u201ca court of appeals may accept an appeal from an order of a district\n\n        court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the State court from which\n\n        it was removed\u201d pursuant to CAFA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). One question before us is\n\n        whether this statute provides the exclusive means for appeal where it applies.\n\n               For Defendants to invoke \u00a7 1291 and appeal as of right in this case, therefore, they\n\n        must clear two hurdles. First, our review must not be precluded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)\u2019s\n\n        limitation on appellate review of remand orders. Second, Defendants must not be\n\n        statutorily required to use the petition avenue provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). For the\n\n        reasons that follow, we conclude that Defendants can surmount both obstacles;\n\n        consequently, we may review their timely appeals pursuant to \u00a7 1291. 6\n\n                                                     B.\n\n               \u201cAppellate review of a district court order remanding a removed case to state court\n\n        is circumscribed by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Republican Nat\u2019l Comm. v. N.C. State Bd. of\n\n        Elections, 120 F.4th 390, 398 (4th Cir. 2024). That statute \u201cprovides broadly that, with\n\n        some exceptions not applicable here, \u2018[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from\n\n\n               6\n                 We thank amicus, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, for\n        helpful briefing and oral argument on this point.\n\n                                                      9\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 10 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u2019\u201d Protopapas v. Travelers\n\n        Cas. & Sur. Co., 94 F.4th 351, 356 (4th Cir. 2024) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d)). On its\n\n        face, then, \u00a7 1447(d) could be understood to preclude review of this appeal under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               But that is not the whole story. In 1976, the Supreme Court took a much narrower\n\n        view of the limitation on appellate review mandated by \u00a7 1447(d) than the plain text of that\n\n        provision standing alone might suggest. In Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, the\n\n        Court explained that \u00a7 1447(d) \u201cmust be construed together\u201d with an adjacent provision,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(c), meaning \u201cthat only remand orders issued under \u00a7 1447(c) and invoking the\n\n        grounds specified therein . . . are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d Thermtron\n\n        Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336, 345\u201346 (1976), abrogated on other grounds\n\n        by Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996). \u201c[T]he grounds for remand\n\n        recognized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d are a \u201cdefect in removal procedure\u201d or a \u201clack of subject-matter\n\n        jurisdiction.\u201d 7 Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995). \u201cThus,\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) bars appellate court review of remand orders\u201d only \u201cwhen they are [colorably]\n\n        based on\u201d one of those grounds. Protopapas, 94 F.4th at 356.\n\n               Neither of these limitations\u2014lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a\n\n        nonjurisdictional defect in the removal process\u2014applies here. There is no dispute that\n\n        Defendants properly removed this case to federal court pursuant to CAFA, see Goldberg,\n\n\n               7\n                 Congress modified 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) in 1996. See Act of Oct. 1, 1996, Pub. L.\n        No. 104-219, \u00a7 1, 110 Stat. 3022, 3022. However, the Supreme Court has continued to rely\n        on its pre-amendment case law interpreting \u00a7 1447(c) and (d). E.g., Kircher v. Putnam\n        Funds Tr., 547 U.S. 633, 640 (2006). We and other circuits have done the same. E.g.,\n        Bartels ex rel. Bartels v. Saber Healthcare Grp., LLC, 880 F.3d 668, 673 (4th Cir. 2018);\n        accord Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d 634, 639 n.3 (5th Cir. 2016) (collecting cases).\n\n                                                    10\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 11 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        2024 WL 1050942, at *3, or that CAFA gives the district court original jurisdiction over\n\n        this matter, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(2).\n\n               Rather, Plaintiffs invoke the local-controversy exception to CAFA jurisdiction. But\n\n        as explained further below, even if Plaintiffs are correct that it applies, that exception does\n\n        not deprive the district court of jurisdiction; it merely provides that a district court\n\n        possessing such jurisdiction must decline to exercise it. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A); see Scott v.\n\n        Cricket Commc\u2019ns, LLC, 865 F.3d 189, 196 n.6 (4th Cir. 2017). And because the use of\n\n        the word \u201c\u2018defect\u2019 [in \u00a7 1447(c)] refers to a failure to comply with the statutory\n\n        requirements for removal,\u201d Bynum v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co. (In re Norfolk S. Ry. Co.), 756\n\n        F.3d 282, 292 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Kamm v. ITEX Corp., 568 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.\n\n        2009)), we agree with the circuit courts\u2019 consensus that a remand order based on one of\n\n        CAFA\u2019s exceptions to the otherwise valid exercise of CAFA jurisdiction does not\n\n        demonstrate a defect in the removal procedure, see, e.g., Watson v. City of Allen, 821 F.3d\n\n        634, 639 (5th Cir. 2016); Graphic Commc\u2019ns Loc. 1B Health & Welfare Fund \u201cA\u201d v.

GreenSky, LLC, 29 F.4th\n\n        1262, 1265\u201366 (11th Cir. 2022).\n\n               Sections 1447(c) and (d) thus pose no bar to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1291 in\n\n        this circumstance. 8 And, as noted, \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n\n               8\n                 The inapplicability of \u00a7 1447(c) to remand motions based on CAFA exceptions\n        raises the question of when parties seeking remand must file such motions, because\n        \u00a7 1447(c) supplies the deadline for the motions that fall within its ambit (thirty days for\n        defects in removal procedure and no deadline for lack of subject matter jurisdiction), and\n        there is no other applicable statute supplying a deadline. Several circuits have used a\n\n\n                                                      11\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 12 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614 (emphasis added). So, notwithstanding \u00a7 1447(d), \u00a7 1291 is an available pathway\n\n        for appeal of an order remanding a case based on CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception\u2014\n\n        unless, as we discuss next, \u00a7 1453 precludes Defendants from using that pathway. Accord\n\n        Cheapside Mins., Ltd. v. Devon Energy Prod.

We agree with the three courts of appeals that have addressed this question\n\n        and conclude that \u00a7 1453 is nonexclusive.\n\n               In 2001, we held broadly that \u201c[r]emand orders that are not subsumed under the\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d) prohibition may be appealed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d Hinson, 239 F.3d\n\n        at 614. But four years later, Congress enacted CAFA, and with it the provision for review\n\n        codified at \u00a7 1453(c). Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, \u00a7 5, 119 Stat.\n\n\n        \u201creasonable time\u201d rule for remand motions where \u00a7 1447(c) does not apply. Watson, 821\n        F.3d at 640 (collecting cases). We need not resolve the matter in this case because\n        Defendants did not argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion\u2014which was filed within thirty days of\n        removal, as calculated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a)(1)(C)\u2014was untimely.\n\n                                                     12\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        4, 12\u201313 (codified as amended at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)). So, we must consider whether that\n\n        enactment created an exception to the general reviewability of remand orders under \u00a7 1291\n\n        for remands based on CAFA\u2019s exceptions.\n\n               Section 1453(c) provides that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case\n\n        under [CAFA], except that notwithstanding section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept\n\n        an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class\n\n        action to the State court from which it was removed if application is made to the court of\n\n        appeals not more than 10 days after entry of the order.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(1). If the\n\n        appellate court \u201caccepts\u201d such an appeal, \u201cthe court shall complete all action on such\n\n        appeal, including rendering judgment, not later than 60 days after the date on which\u201d it\n\n        accepts the appeal, 9 unless it grants an extension \u201cfor any period of time\u201d with the\n\n        agreement of all parties or \u201cfor a period not to exceed 10 days\u201d if the \u201cextension is for good\n\n        cause shown and in the interests of justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1453(c)(2)\u2013(3). \u201cIf a final judgment on\n\n\n\n               9\n                  Section 1453 states that the deadline is \u201cnot later than 60 days after the date on\n        which such appeal was filed.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(c)(2) (emphasis added). This \u201ccreates an\n        ambiguity\u2014the appeal might be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the application is made, but it also\n        may be thought \u2018filed\u2019 when the court \u2018accepts an appeal.\u2019\u201d Wright & Miller, supra,\n        \u00a7 3931.2.

The \u00a7 1453 petitioner must seek permission to appeal and\n\n        demonstrate to the appellate court why appeal is necessary, see Dominion Energy v. City\n\n        of Warren Police & Fire Ret. Sys., 928 F.3d 325, 334 (4th Cir. 2019) (describing this\n\n        Court\u2019s \u201cnon-exhaustive list of [eight] factors\u201d for evaluating CAFA petitions for\n\n        permission to appeal); the \u00a7 1291 appellant need only file a timely notice of appeal. The\n\n        \u00a7 1453 petitioner has just ten days to file this detailed petition; the \u00a7 1291 appellant must\n\n        merely file a notice of appeal, which includes quite limited details, within either thirty or\n\n        sixty days, depending on the case. See Fed. R. App. P. 3(c), 4(a). And the court must render\n\n        judgment within at most seventy days from the date it accepts the appeal, unless all parties\n\n        agree to an extension; whereas an appellate court considering a \u00a7 1291 appeal faces a much\n\n        more lenient schedule.\n\n               Given the much stricter limits imposed by \u00a7 1453(c), it would, at first blush, seem\n\n        odd to allow parties to circumvent those limits merely by filing an appeal as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291. One might think that interpreting the statutes in this way would \u201crender[]\n\n        [\u00a7 1453(c)] surplusage or violate[] the interpretive principle that the specific controls the\n\n        general.\u201d United States v. Minton, 99 F.4th 692, 695 (4th Cir. 2024). After all, why would\n\n        any party subject itself to those limitations when it could just file a notice of appeal?\n\n               Upon closer review, however, there are situations where a party might prefer\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)\u2014or have no choice but to rely on it. A party might prefer the quick turnaround\n\n\n                                                      14\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025     Pg: 15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        mandated by \u00a7 1453(c). More importantly, a party might have no other option for appeal.\n\n        An order denying a motion to remand is not immediately appealable as of right under\n\n        \u00a7 1291, see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 74 (1996), but is immediately appealable\n\n        by permission under \u00a7 1453(c)(1). Similarly, an order precluded from appeal by\n\n        \u00a7 1447(d)\u2014such as one concluding that there was a defect in the removal itself under\n\n        CAFA\u2014is not appealable under \u00a7 1291, but would be appealable by permission under\n\n        \u00a7 1453(c)(1). It thus appears that the two statutes are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n        See Lara-Aguilar v. Sessions, 889 F.3d 134, 142 (4th Cir. 2018) (explaining that \u201cthe\n\n        general-specific rule of [statutory] construction applies only when specific and general\n\n        statutory provisions conflict\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n               Additionally, nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 1453 suggests it is the exclusive avenue\n\n        for appealing all remand orders based on CAFA exceptions. To be sure, the statute states\n\n        that \u201c[s]ection 1447 shall apply to any removal of a case under this section, except that\n\n        notwithstanding section 1447(d),\u201d we may accept petitions under \u00a7 1453. This could be\n\n        read to suggest that Congress expected \u00a7 1447(d) to preclude all appeals of remand orders\n\n        based on CAFA exceptions, except those permitted through \u00a7 1453.\n\n               However, as discussed, decades before CAFA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\n\n        interpreted \u00a7 1447(d) more narrowly than its plain text might suggest. See Thermtron\n\n        Prods., 423 U.S. at 345\u201346. It reiterated that holding twice in the decade leading up to the\n\n        enactment of CAFA. See Things Remembered, 516 U.S. at 127; Quackenbush, 517 U.S. at\n\n        711\u201312. We generally presume Congress legislates against the backdrop of \u201crelevant\n\n        judicial precedent.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 233 (2020) (quoting Merck\n\n\n                                                    15\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648 (2010)). So, we can presume that Congress was\n\n        aware that a remand order like the one at issue here might be appealable under \u00a7 1291 even\n\n        without the enactment of \u00a7 1453, and that therefore its intention was to provide an\n\n        alternative avenue for appeal. Put another way, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\n        command stating that \u00a7 1453 provides the exclusive avenue for appeals of remand orders,\n\n        and bound as we are by the Supreme Court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1447, we decline to read into the\n\n        statute assumptions that would contradict preexisting Supreme Court precedent in order to\n\n        eliminate the normal pathway of appellate review under \u00a7 1291.\n\n               For all these reasons, we agree with the three courts of appeals that have squarely\n\n        addressed the question that \u00a7 1453 does not supersede \u00a7 1291 for an appeal of an order\n\n        granting remand in a CAFA case, but rather that both statutes provide avenues for appeal.\n\n        See Cheapside Mins., 94 F.4th at 496 (5th Cir.) (\u201c[Section] 1453(c) did not supplant \u00a7 1291\n\n        and become the lone vehicle by which an appellant can obtain review of a final order\n\n        remanding class action litigation to state court; it simply permits certain appeals denying\n\n        remand that \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1291 would have otherwise prohibited.\u201d); Jacks, 701 F.3d at\n\n        1228\u201329 & n.2 (8th Cir.)

Scott, 865 F.3d at 194.\n\n               \u201cCongress enacted CAFA in 2005 to expand subject matter jurisdiction in the\n\n        federal courts over \u2018interstate\u2019 class actions \u2018of national importance.\u2019\u201d Dominion Energy,\n\n        928 F.3d at 329\u201330 (quoting Class Action Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5) (citing\n\n        Standard Fire Ins.

Cap. One Auto Fin., 736 F.3d\n\n        880, 884 (9th Cir. 2013)). That is true, as far as it goes. See Scott, 865 F.3d at 195 (noting\n\n        that, \u201c[o]nce [the plaintiff] challenged [the defendant]\u2019s allegations through a motion to\n\n        remand, [the defendant] was required to prove CAFA jurisdiction exists by a\n\n        preponderance of the evidence\u201d). But, as discussed, the application of a CAFA exception\n\n        under \u00a7 1332(d)(3) or (4) is not jurisdictional, because it does not defeat the district court\u2019s\n\n        original jurisdiction; rather, it permits or mandates abstention. E.g., Dutcher, 840 F.3d at\n\n        1190.\n\n                Perhaps for that reason, \u201c[s]ome district courts\u201d have held plaintiffs to a \u201cless[er]\u201d\n\n        standard than a preponderance of the evidence, \u201cembracing a reasonable-probability\n\n        standard or something akin to it.\u201d Reece, 638 F. App\u2019x at 768 (10th Cir.) (collecting cases).\n\n        The Tenth Circuit considered this option in its unpublished decision in Nichols v.\n\n        Chesapeake Operating, LLC, but rejected it in favor of \u201cthe more exacting preponderance-\n\n        of-the-evidence standard\u201d because \u201c[t]hat standard is consistent with the \u2018strong preference\n\n        that interstate class actions should be heard in a federal court if properly removed by any\n\n        defendant.\u2019\u201d Nichols v.

CAFA specifies no standard of proof for this issue. \u201cFaced with\u201d textual\n\n        \u201csilence, courts usually apply the default preponderance standard.\u201d E.M.D. Sales, Inc. v.\n\n\n                                                       21\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142       Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 22 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Carrera, 604 U.S. 45, 52 (2025). Nothing in CAFA\u2019s text, structure, or purpose rebuts that\n\n        presumption; rather the opposite. As we have recognized, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and\n\n        apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal\n\n        exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. Holding plaintiffs to\n\n        a burden more lenient than a preponderance would not honor that obligation. At the same\n\n        time, given that the defendants bear the burden to establish jurisdiction, whereas plaintiffs\u2019\n\n        burden concerns a nonjurisdictional question, we do not think that (absent statutory\n\n        language requiring it) the burden ought to be higher on plaintiffs than it is on defendants.\n\n        Cf. Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886 (\u201cThe burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff [seeking to\n\n        invoke the local-controversy exception] should not be exceptionally difficult to bear.\u201d);\n\n        Preston v.

Yet because\n        questions of removal are typically decided at the pleadings stage where little or no evidence\n        has yet been produced, the removing defendant\u2019s burden is better framed in terms of a\n        \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 not a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). For simplicity, we use the\n        language of \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d regardless of whether the matter is considered\n        on the pleadings alone, but we raise the First Circuit\u2019s point to the extent it is helpful for\n        thinking about what this standard means in the context of a pleadings-only inquiry.\n                Relatedly, Skyline suggests that there is a circuit split on the question of \u201cwhether a\n        court, in reviewing a remand motion, may consider materials outside of the pleadings . . .\n        such as was submitted and considered by the district court here.\u201d Oral Arg. at 14:19\u201314:35;\n        accord Skyline Opening Br. at 15\u201316. However, the circuit split pertains only to those\n        elements of the local-controversy exception for which the statute specifically uses the\n        words \u201csought\u201d and \u201calleged\u201d (namely, the significant-basis and significant-relief prongs).\n        Some circuits have held that this statutory language limits the district court to considering\n        only the complaint for those prongs. E.g., Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157 (3d Cir.); Coleman v.\n        Estes Express Lines, Inc., 631 F.3d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir. 2011). Other circuits disagree.\n        E.g., Atwood v. Peterson, 936 F.3d 835, 840 (8th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (considering\n        affidavits in evaluating significant-basis prong); Evans, 449 F.3d at 1167 (11th Cir.) (same,\n        for both significant-basis and significant-relief prongs). But because the parties relied only\n        on Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in making their arguments related to those aspects of the local-\n        controversy exception, the question of whether extrinsic evidence can be considered for\n        those prongs is not presented in this case. And we are not aware of any authority holding\n        that plaintiffs cannot produce extrinsic evidence to support their burden for purposes of the\n        citizenship prong. To the contrary, several circuits have held that, where the defendant\n        challenges the citizenship element and the class is not already definitionally limited to\n        citizens of a particular state, \u201cthere must ordinarily be at least some facts in evidence from\n        which the district court may make findings regarding class members\u2019 citizenship for\n        purposes of CAFA\u2019s local controversy exception.\u201d Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 884 (collecting\n        cases). We therefore conclude that Plaintiffs could properly introduce evidence related to\n        citizenship.\n\n                                                      23\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 24 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        point. We agree with the district court that they have.\n\n               The citizenship element can be satisfied by definitionally limiting the class to\n\n        citizens of the state in question. E.g., In re Sprint Nextel Corp., 593 F.3d 669, 676 (7th Cir.\n\n        2010); cf. Advance Am., 549 F.3d at 937 (4th Cir.) (similar). But Plaintiffs did not do that\n\n        here; rather, the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property is located within\n\n        a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022.\u201d J.A. 21. There is no dispute\n\n        that the covered area falls entirely within Maryland, so the only question is whether\n\n        Plaintiffs have sufficiently shown that at least two-thirds of these property owners are\n\n        Maryland citizens.\n\n               The only evidence before us consists of two affidavits provided by a paralegal,\n\n        Denise Greeley, that Plaintiffs attached to their motion to remand and related reply. 13\n\n        (Defendants did not separately put forward any evidence.) Greeley explained that she used\n\n        web tools \u201cto geographically map a 4000-foot radius from the TV Tower\u201d and \u201cdetermine\n\n        the postal addresses for the [2,785] properties located in\u201d that area. J.A. 143. She then used\n\n        \u201cthe Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation\u2019s (\u2018SDAT\u2019) Real Property\n\n        Data Search tool\u201d and \u201cBusiness Entity Data Search tool\u201d to identify the owners for each\n\n        property. J.A. 101. She counted individuals as citizens only if they listed a Maryland\n\n\n               13\n                  Plaintiffs sought to provide additional evidence through representations at oral\n        argument. Because our conclusion is the same with or without this belated evidence, we\n        need not decide whether we can consider it on this nonjurisdictional question. Compare\n        Williams v. Kincaid, 45 F.4th 759, 776 n.10 (4th Cir. 2022) (noting general principle that\n        \u201cwe are a court of review, not of first view\u201d (quoting United States v.

She counted businesses as citizens only if they\n\n        were \u201ceither organized under Maryland law or had [their] principal place of business in\n\n        Maryland.\u201d Id. The properties also included 80 local governmental properties. J.A. 143.\n\n        Greeley explained that, including the governmental properties, 2,416 of the owners (about\n\n        87%) were Maryland citizens; excluding them, 2,336 (about 84%) were. The district court\n\n        credited this evidence and thus concluded that Plaintiffs had satisfied their burden to show\n\n        that more than two-thirds of the members of the proposed class were Maryland citizens.\n\n               We agree with the district court\u2019s decision to credit Greeley\u2019s citizenship analysis\n\n        as to the property owners who are either businesses or natural persons. We therefore do not\n\n        need to consider the governmental properties, as Plaintiffs satisfy the citizenship prong\n\n        with or without them.\n\n                                                     1.\n\n               We begin with the businesses. For purposes of CAFA, every business entity\u2014\n\n        whether a corporation or an unincorporated association like an LLC\u2014is deemed to be a\n\n        citizen of the state where it was incorporated or under whose laws it was organized, as well\n\n        as the state where it has its principal place of business. 14 See Ferrell v. Express Check\n\n        Advance of SC LLC, 591 F.3d 698, 701\u201305 (4th Cir. 2010) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1),\n\n        (d)(10)). This is the exact definition Greeley averred she used in searching the business-\n\n        entity class members on Maryland\u2019s websites. See J.A. 101 (\u201cIf a 4000 Foot Property owner\n\n\n               14\n                  CAFA thus alters the \u201ctraditional rule\u201d for diversity jurisdiction, under which \u201ca\n        limited liability company\u2019s \u2018citizenship is that of its members.\u2019\u201d Ferrell v.

Certainly, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s\n\n        implicit conclusion that this definition satisfied Plaintiffs\u2019 preponderance-based burden.\n\n                                                      2.\n\n               That leaves the more complicated question of the individual property owners. While\n\n        CAFA defines the term \u201ccitizen\u201d for corporations and unincorporated associations, it\n\n        provides no definition for individuals. We therefore will presume, for purposes of this\n\n\n                                                      26\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142        Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025       Pg: 27 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        analysis, that \u201ccitizen\u201d carries the same meaning for the local-controversy exception under\n\n        \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A) as it does for diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a). See Hargett v.\n\n        RevClaims, LLC, 854 F.3d 962, 965 (8th Cir. 2017). Under that definition, \u201c[a] person is a\n\n        citizen of a state only if she is a citizen of the United States and a domiciliary of that state,\u201d\n\n        that is, someone who \u201chas an intention to remain in the state indefinitely.\u201d Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 195.\n\n                  The assumption that the local-controversy exception uses the same definition of\n\n        citizenship for individual class members as does the diversity-jurisdiction provision does\n\n        not, however, resolve what evidence a plaintiff must produce to establish citizenship. In\n\n        the context of diversity jurisdiction, residency alone is insufficient to establish citizenship.\n\n        Id. But in the context of CAFA\u2019s local-controversy exception, we think that residency\n\n        suffices to create a rebuttable presumption of citizenship.\n\n                  The Sixth Circuit persuasively discussed this issue in Mason v. Lockwood, Andrews\n\n        & Newnam, P.C., 842 F.3d 383. There, the court gave a historical overview of the\n\n        longstanding \u201crebuttable presumption that a person\u2019s residence is his domicile.\u201d Id. at 390.\n\n        It further explained that, while the \u201cprinciple\u201d that residence alone is insufficient to show\n\n        citizenship \u201calso enjoys a rich pedigree in our law,\u201d the latter rule emerged in the context\n\n        of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, which is, of course, highly circumscribed. Id. at 391.\n\n        Thus, the court noted, in 1878, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that \u201ca general\n\n        allegation of residence\u201d was sufficient to demonstrate citizenship and therefore support\n\n        federal jurisdiction. Id. (quoting Robertson v. Cease, 97 U.S. (7 Otto) 646, 649 (1878)).\n\n        But, \u201c[b]y tracing the origin of the \u2018mere averment of residency\u2019 line of cases, we see that\n\n\n                                                       27\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 28 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        the residency-domicile presumption was not rejected because it was specious (indeed,\n\n        Robertson could \u2018not . . . den[y] that there is some force in the[ ] suggestion[ ]\u2019), but\n\n        because, in the unique context of federal diversity jurisdiction, a contrary presumption of\n\n        constitutional import takes precedence.\u201d Id. at 392 (emphasis added) (citation omitted)\n\n        (quoting Robertson, 97 U.S. at 649).\n\n               However, the local-controversy exception is not jurisdictional. See Scott, 865 F.3d\n\n        at 196 n.6 (citing Mason, 842 F.3d at 392). Instead, we must be guided by considerations\n\n        of statutory interpretation. And here, \u201cCongress has expressly directed [federal] courts to\n\n        decline jurisdiction over local controversies,\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 394, while \u201cproviding\n\n        for Federal court consideration of interstate cases of national importance,\u201d Class Action\n\n        Fairness Act \u00a7 2(b)(2), 119 Stat. at 5.\n\n               Certainly, \u201cwe are obliged to construe and apply CAFA\u2019s grant of federal court\n\n        jurisdiction broadly, and to apply the three removal exceptions in a narrow fashion.\u201d\n\n        Dominion Energy, 928 F.3d at 336. But this is because of CAFA\u2019s \u201cobjective of ensuring\n\n        that interstate class action claims of national importance are heard and resolved in the\n\n        federal courts.\u201d Id. at 338. At the same time, as several circuits have emphasized, \u201c[t]he\n\n        citizenship inquiry under the local controversy exception should not be \u2018exceptionally\n\n        difficult,\u2019 but instead \u2018practical and reasonable.\u2019\u201d Mason, 842 F.3d at 392 (citations\n\n        omitted) (first quoting Mondragon, 736 F.3d at 886; and then quoting Hollinger v.

Where a plaintiff class presents evidence that a class member\n\n        is a resident of a given state, it is eminently reasonable for the district court to adopt a\n\n        rebuttable presumption that the class member is a citizen of that state.

We further note that some other circuits have signaled\n\n        openness to this line of reasoning. 16 See Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 571, 573\u201374 (5th Cir.)\n\n        (stating that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s place of residence . . . is prima facie proof of his\n\n        domicile\u201d and that \u201cwhere a proposed class is discrete in nature, a common sense\n\n        presumption should be utilized in determining whether citizenship requirements have been\n\n        met,\u201d and citing favorably a district court decision concluding that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 assertions\n\n        that they represented a class of individuals covered by homeowner\u2019s policies for homes\n\n\n               16\n                  We also recognize that some other circuits disagree.

And the burden on defendants to\n\n        rebut the presumption will depend on the specific facts of the case. For example, residency\n\n        is weaker evidence of citizenship where a significant percentage of the class can be\n\n        expected to be only temporary residents\u2014such as where a large number of class members\n\n        are residents of a university campus, a military base, or an area with many vacation homes.\n\n        See Mason, 842 F.3d at 395. By contrast, property ownership is a \u201cstrong indicator of\n\n        domicile,\u201d so defendants faced with evidence that the plaintiff class is largely made up of\n\n        residents who own their homes will have a more difficult time rebutting the presumption\n\n        that those residents are citizens. Id.\n\n               Turning to the case at hand, Plaintiffs counted as citizens only those individuals\n\n        whose principal residence was listed on SDAT\u2019s website as a residence in Maryland. Under\n\n\n\n\n                                                     31\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025    Pg: 32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        Maryland\u2019s regulations\u2014which SDAT\u2019s website cites 17\u2014the \u201cprincipal residence\u201d for\n\n        these purposes \u201cis the one dwelling where the homeowner regularly resides and is the\n\n        location designated by the owner for the legal purposes of voting, obtaining a driver\u2019s\n\n        license, and filing income tax returns.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 18.07.03.01. The individual class\n\n        members are thus residents of Maryland, triggering the rebuttable presumption of\n\n        citizenship. Further, because the proposed class is \u201call real property owners whose property\n\n        is located within a 4000-foot radius of the TV Tower on or after May 28, 2022,\u201d the\n\n        individual class members are people who not only have their principal residence within\n\n        Maryland, but also own property within Maryland. J.A. 21. That is more than enough to\n\n        meet Plaintiffs\u2019 burden in this case.\n\n               Defendants cite no contrary evidence. Instead, they quibble that \u201cPlaintiffs failed to\n\n        include any data regarding the timeframe or year(s) for which any property owners declared\n\n        any properties as a \u2018principal residence.\u2019\u201d Skyline Opening Br. at 12.\n\n               The relevant timeframe, for purposes of the statute, is \u201cthe date of filing of the\n\n        complaint,\u201d which in this case was May 10, 2023. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(7).

Because TTI is the only Maryland-citizen defendant,\n\n        Plaintiffs must satisfy this element as to TTI to be able to invoke the local-controversy\n\n        exception. We conclude that they have done so.\n\n\n                                                     33\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 34 of 42\n\n\n\n\n               This Court has only considered the meaning of the \u201cat least one defendant\u201d rule\n\n        once, in our 2013 opinion in Quicken Loans Inc. v. Alig, 737 F.3d 960. However, there, we\n\n        did not evaluate the meaning of \u201csignificant basis\u201d or \u201csignificant relief,\u201d instead resolving\n\n        only the question of whether several local defendants could be aggregated for purposes of\n\n        determining whether this element was met. So, this case presents an opportunity to flesh\n\n        out what the statute means by \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis.\u201d\n\n               We face two questions: first, can there be more than one defendant who satisfies the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d prongs, or must a local defendant be the\n\n        defendant against whom the most significant relief is sought and whose conduct forms the\n\n        most significant basis of the action? Second, if a local defendant need not be superlatively\n\n        significant in this way, how significant must the basis and relief be to qualify?\n\n               TTI contends that the answer to the first question is that the local defendant must be\n\n        superlatively significant. See Oral Arg. at 43:25\u201343:35, https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/\n\n        OAarchive/mp3/24-0141-20250508.mp3 (\u201cThe local defendant needs to be more\n\n        significant [than the out-of-state defendant] because that is the anchor by which the court\n\n        will decide to treat it as a purely local controversy under th[e] exception.\u201d). That is plainly\n\n        wrong.\n\n               In Quicken Loans, we noted that the statute refers to \u201cat least 1 defendant\u201d and that\n\n        \u201c[u]nder common parlance, the term \u2018at least\u2019 permits a reading that more than one\n\n        defendant could satisfy the stated criteria.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965. So, we\n\n        concluded, the local defendants could be aggregated to determine whether they satisfied\n\n        this prong. We imagined \u201ca putative class action wherein all twenty named defendants,\n\n\n                                                      34\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        except one, reside in the same state. There is no dispute that the one out-of-state defendant\n\n        is an insignificant defendant for purposes of relief and the basis of the suit. The remaining\n\n        nineteen in-state defendants are 99.99 percent liable and meet the \u2018significant relief\u2019 and\n\n        \u2018significant basis\u2019 factors as a group and in equal proportion to each other\u20145.26 percent\n\n        each.\u201d Id. We took the view that, even if each local defendant would not be \u201csignificant\u201d\n\n        alone, the statute was plainly satisfied because local defendants as a group obviously were.\n\n               This case presents a slightly different question, but the answer here is even more\n\n        straightforward under the language of the statute. Quicken Loans\u2019s insight that \u201cat least 1\u201d\n\n        means that more than one defendant could satisfy the significance prong directly applies in\n\n        a situation like this one. That is, if there are two or three or four defendants with roughly\n\n        equal (or even unequal, but still significant) liability, more than one could satisfy the\n\n        \u201csignificant relief\u201d and \u201csignificant basis\u201d requirements. Put more concretely, if a\n\n        complaint named three defendants and alleged that the local defendant was 25% liable, one\n\n        out-of-state defendant was 40% liable, and the other out-of-state defendant was 35% liable,\n\n        all three would be \u201csignificant\u201d so long as 25% liability suffices for significance. So, here,\n\n        it doesn\u2019t matter if Skyline is allegedly more liable than (or just as liable as) TTI, so long\n\n        as Plaintiffs seek \u201csignificant relief\u201d from TTI and TTI\u2019s conduct \u201cforms a significant\n\n        basis\u201d for the claims.\n\n               The First Circuit\u2019s recent decision in Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v.

As Kress Stores explained, Kaufman\u2019s \u201ctest is relative: . . . .\n\n        \u2018If the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct is a significant part of the alleged conduct of all\n\n        the Defendants, then the significant basis provision is satisfied. Whether this condition is\n\n        met requires a substantive analysis comparing the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct to the\n\n        alleged conduct of all the Defendants.\u2019\u201d Id. at 239 (quoting Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 156).\n\n               Kress Stores elaborated, however, that \u201ccourts adopting Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach have split over its application to . . . claims alleging that local and non-local\n\n        defendants \u2018all engaged in the same conduct.\u2019\u201d Id. at 240 (quoting Kitchin v. Bridgeton\n\n        Landfill, LLC, 3 F.4th 1089, 1094 (8th Cir. 2021)). While some have found such allegations\n\n        sufficient to show significance, others \u201chave required some sort of plus-factor in the\n\n        allegations of a local defendant\u2019s conduct (as compared to non-local defendants\u2019 conduct)\n\n        to count the local defendant\u2019s conduct as \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Id.\n\n        (collecting cases).\n\n               TTI seems to urge this Court to adopt a standard akin to the plus-factor analysis,\n\n        arguing that \u201cthe local defendant\u2019s conduct cannot be \u2018significant\u2019 if the alleged importance\n\n        is either equivalent or collective.\u201d TTI Opening Br. at 16; see also Oral Arg. at 11:50\u2013\n\n        12:13, 43:00\u201343:17.

Because the local-\n\n        controversy exception requires only that the local defendant be \u201csignificant,\u201d while the\n\n        home-state exception refers to \u201cthe primary defendants,\u201d a review of the statute as a whole\n\n        supports that the local-controversy does not require that the local defendant be\n\n        superlatively \u201cprimary,\u201d but merely \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n               Our interpretation is also supported by the CAFA Senate Report, \u201cwhich contains\n\n        the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s views with respect to CAFA jurisdiction,\u201d and on which\n\n        \u201c[b]oth the Supreme Court and our Court have heretofore had occasion to rely.\u201d Dominion\n\n        Energy, 928 F.3d at 336 n.11 (collecting cases).

The defendant\n\n\n                                                       37\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 38 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        must be a target from whom significant relief is sought by the class (as opposed to just a\n\n        subset of the class membership), as well as being a defendant whose alleged conduct forms\n\n        a significant basis for the claims asserted by the class.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40 (2005)\n\n        (emphasis added). The Report\u2019s use of the indefinite article\u2014\u201ca,\u201d not \u201cthe\u201d\u2014suggests that\n\n        Congress did not intend to require that the local defendant be superlatively significant.\n\n               Accordingly, we follow the First Circuit\u2019s lead and adopt Kaufman\u2019s comparative\n\n        approach while noting that \u201csuch comparisons must admit the possibility (clear from\n\n        CAFA\u2019s text) that more than one defendant\u2019s conduct can be \u2018a significant basis\u2019 of the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Kress Stores, 121 F.4th at 241. Here, that means that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\n        whether Skyline is a significant defendant, so long as TTI is.\n\n               That leaves the question of what \u201csignificant\u201d means. \u201cSeveral dictionaries offer\n\n        complementary definitions of \u2018significant,\u2019 with each suggesting that the word essentially\n\n        means \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018characterized by a large amount or quantity.\u2019\u201d Benko v. Quality Loan\n\n        Serv. Corp., 789 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir. 2015). The Senate Report similarly indicates\n\n        that the defendant must be \u201ca primary focus,\u201d \u201cnot just a peripheral defendant\u201d or \u201cisolated\n\n        role player.\u201d S. Rep. No. 109-14, at 40. The Ninth Circuit has found the element satisfied\n\n        where the local defendant\u2019s \u201cactivities constituted between 15 to 20% of the [challenged]\n\n        activities of all the Defendants.\u201d Benko, 789 F.3d at 1119; cf. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 157\n\n        (vacating district court decision where local defendant sold 13% of all policies in the state,\n\n        not because 13% was insufficient, but because not all policies sold necessarily violated the\n\n        law, and therefore the district court\u2019s calculation had not properly focused on the alleged\n\n        conduct). By contrast, in unpublished authority, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that 4.5%\n\n\n                                                     38\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        liability is insufficient and suggested that 14% would also be insufficient. Lemy v. Direct\n\n        Gen. Fin. Co., 559 F. App\u2019x 796, 798 & n.1 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam). Similarly, the\n\n        hypothetical example we contemplated in Quicken Loans implied that 5.26% liability\n\n        would not be \u201csignificant.\u201d Quicken Loans, 737 F.3d at 965.\n\n               We need not adopt a specific numerical threshold to resolve this matter because we\n\n        conclude that the allegations in this case easily clear the significant-basis and significant-\n\n        relief hurdles.\n\n               The complaint alleges that TTI owns the TV tower; knew by the 1980s that it was\n\n        coated in lead-based paint; was aware that the paint would deteriorate over time; and knew\n\n        that hydroblasting would dislodge lead paint recklessly and dangerously. 18 Nevertheless,\n\n        it allegedly contracted with Skyline; failed to verify that Skyline was appropriately\n\n        accredited, licensed, or trained to perform the work (which it was not); and failed to obtain\n\n        the appropriate permit or notify local authorities prior to undertaking the work.\n\n               TTI is thus not a peripheral player, but rather is one of two defendants, both of whom\n\n        are central to the allegations in the complaint. Plaintiffs seek to hold TTI responsible not\n\n        only for the actions of the company it hired to perform the work, but also for its own\n\n        negligence in failing to obtain the proper permits and failing to hire a properly accredited\n\n        company to undertake work it knew would be hazardous to the surrounding community.\n\n        That means the relief sought against TTI is substantial, even if Skyline was the entity\n\n\n               18\n                 Knowledge and ownership may not themselves be \u201cconduct,\u201d as CAFA uses the\n        term. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(4)(A)(i)(II)(bb); see Conduct, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed.\n        2024) (\u201cPersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\u201d) Because TTI\u2019s conduct\n        remains significant even if we omit those allegations, we do not resolve the issue.\n\n                                                     39\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 40 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        actually tasked with the hydroblasting. See Goldberg, 2024 WL 1050942, at *15 (district\n\n        court concluding that \u201cif Plaintiffs meet their burdens as to Counts I and II, TTI\u2019s liability\n\n        could meet (or exceed) that of Skyline\u201d).\n\n               The Ninth Circuit provided helpful analysis in a similar case, Allen v. Boeing Co.,\n\n        in which a class sued Boeing (an out-of-state defendant) and Landau Associates (a local\n\n        defendant). Allen v. Boeing Co., 821 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir. 2016). It alleged that Boeing\n\n        had caused pollution at its manufacturing plant from the 1960s to 1990s. Id. at 1114. In\n\n        2002, Boeing contracted with Landau to conduct remediation. Id. Also in 2002, and again\n\n        in 2009, Boeing and Landau became aware of new pollution issues, but \u201cfailed to take\n\n        reasonable actions to investigate and remediate\u201d those issues. Id. In a 2013 lawsuit brought\n\n        in state court, the plaintiffs sued Boeing for negligence, nuisance, and trespass; sued\n\n        Landau for negligence; and sought damages from both. Id. at 1115. Boeing removed the\n\n        case to federal court pursuant to CAFA and appealed after the district court granted the\n\n        plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand pursuant to the local-controversy exception. Id. at 1113.\n\n               The Ninth Circuit affirmed. Id. at 1113\u201314. It concluded that the plaintiffs had\n\n        shown that they sought significant relief against the local defendant, Landau, and that its\n\n        actions constituted a significant basis for relief. The court held that, while \u201cBoeing\u2019s\n\n        activities over several decades created the hazardous\u201d pollution, \u201cit does not follow that\n\n        Boeing\u2019s liability (if any) for creating the pollutants necessarily dwarfs Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\n\n        against Landau\u201d because \u201c[i]f Landau is shown to have failed, for more than a decade, to\n\n        remediate the spreading toxic chemical plumes, its liability could be as great as Boeing\u2019s.\u201d\n\n        Id. at 1118\u201319. While the facts here are of course different, the point remains that just\n\n\n                                                     40\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91          Filed: 08/01/2025      Pg: 41 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        because one defendant is alleged to be a major polluter does not mean that another\n\n        defendant cannot be alleged to be significantly liable for its own negligence related to that\n\n        pollution.\n\n               Before closing, we note that TTI appears to argue that, because the complaint\n\n        includes a claim solely against Skyline (Count II), Plaintiffs cannot show that the alleged\n\n        conduct \u201cforms a significant basis for all the claims asserted in the action,\u201d as the Third\n\n        Circuit required in Kaufman. Kaufman, 561 F.3d at 155 (emphasis added). If that is what\n\n        TTI means, it misreads Kaufman, which clarified that \u201c[t]he [local-controversy] provision\n\n        does not require that the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct form a basis of each claim\n\n        asserted; it requires the alleged conduct to form a significant basis of all the claims\n\n        asserted.\u201d Id. (third emphasis added). Kaufman elaborated that, \u201c[w]hile assessing the\n\n        quantity of claims based on the local defendant\u2019s alleged conduct may be useful to the\n\n        analysis, the significant basis provision does not establish an absolute quantitative\n\n        requirement. Nor is it necessary to imply such a quantitative requirement to make sense of\n\n        the provision, for a party\u2019s conduct may form a significant basis of an entire set of claims\n\n        even if some claims within the set are not based on that conduct.\u201d Id. at 155\u201356. We agree:\n\n        nothing in the statute indicates that, if there is even a single claim not asserted against the\n\n        local defendant, the local-controversy exception does not apply.\n\n                                                     IV.\n\n               For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal\n\n        under \u00a7 1291. We dismiss Defendants\u2019 petitions for review under \u00a7 1453 as unnecessary.\n\n        And we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that the local-controversy exception applies\n\n\n                                                      41\n\fUSCA4 Appeal: 24-142      Doc: 91         Filed: 08/01/2025   Pg: 42 of 42\n\n\n\n\n        and that remand to the state court is required.\n\n                                                                AFFIRMED; PETITIONS FOR\n                                                                      REVIEW DISMISSED\n\n\n\n\n                                                     42"

We\n\nuphold the trial court\u2019s order finding the contract illusory. We also find that the evidence\n\nsupporting the jury\u2019s verdict was legally insufficient and that the trial court erred in denying\n\nappellants\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). Accordingly, we\n\naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgment in part and reverse and render in part.\n\n                                    I.      BACKGROUND\n\n       Appellees Christian Tijerina and Joe Zacarias were engaged to be married and\n\nsought a venue for their wedding reception. On July 31, 2019, Tijerina visited appellants\u2019\n\nbusiness called \u201cThe Gala Special Events\u201d (The Gala) and met with Saida Barrera, wife\n\nof the owner Victor. They discussed appellees\u2019 needs for the reception. After their\n\ndiscussion, Tijerina signed a contract for the reception to be held at the venue on May 2,\n\n2020. Saida testified that The Gala had used the same form contract since 2012. Tijerina\n\ndid not have a lawyer with her when the contract was executed.\n\n       According to Tijerina, Saida did not explain most of the contract to her, discussing\n\nit for only five to ten minutes. Saida and Tijerina did not discuss the contract\u2019s liquidated\n\ndamages and force majeure provisions. The contract contained the following relevant\n\ncancellation provisions: \u201c[(]1) If the client cancels or rebooks the date or [T]he Gala\n\nterminates for any reason the scheduled special event, the client loses automatically all\n\ndeposits, security deposit[,] and any other payments made up to the date of the\n\ncancellation or termination\u201d; and \u201c(3) If for any reason The Gala must cancel for a unseen\n\nnatural disaster, or emergency The Gala cannot be held responsible and there will be no\n\nreimbursements, nor rescheduled event.\u201d Tijerina testified she would not have signed the\n\ncontract if she were made aware of these provisions and stated that Saida\u2019s only\n\n\n                                               2\n\fexplanation regarding cancellation was that the sole way appellees could lose their\n\ndeposit money is if appellees cancelled the event. Zacarias testified similarly.\n\n       Saida testified that it was not appellants\u2019 policy to explain every line and page of\n\nthe contract to a customer. Appellants ensured that the customer reviewed the contract\n\nbefore signing and made themselves available to answer questions about it, but Saida\n\nstated it was the customer\u2019s responsibility to read the contract. She stated this was\n\nimportant so that they understood what rights they did and did not have under the\n\ncontract. She also testified that appellants\u2019 employees were trained to be familiar with the\n\ncontract and its provisions.\n\n       At her pretrial deposition, Saida testified that she did not recall whether Tijerina\n\nread the entire contract or not. She also stated that she was familiar with the contract\u2019s\n\nprovisions. Saida explained the liquidated damages clause meant that if the customer\n\nmoves or cancels the event date then the customer loses all money paid at that point.\n\nShe did not recall if she discussed these provisions with Tijerina.\n\n       Tijerina did not plan to sign a contract that day but agreed to after Saida offered a\n\n$3,000 discount as a promotion. No one signed the contract on behalf of appellants.\n\nTijerina asked to take a day to discuss the deal with Zacarias but claims Saida stated the\n\ndiscount would only be offered on that day and that a deposit had to be made. However,\n\nthe separate written discount offer had no expiration date. Saida testified that she did not\n\nrecall the details of this conversation and did not recall the exact details of the promotion\n\nor discount. Appellants did not retain written details about when the promotion stopped\n\nor started, and Saida could not recall when it began or ended. She also testified that she\n\nwas not sure about what the business was charging in 2022 for the same package offered\n\n\n                                             3\n\fto appellees. At her deposition, she stated that she and her husband decided when to\n\nstop and start promotional pricing.\n\n       To sign the contract, Tijerina called Zacarias and asked him to bring a $500 deposit\n\nto the venue. Zacarias did so and appellees jointly toured the location with Saida. Zacarias\n\ntestified that he did not review the contract and was not given the contract to review. It is\n\nundisputed that Zacarias did not sign the contract. According to Tijerina, it was important\n\nthat the wedding occur on a Saturday and they \u201cpaid extra\u201d for a Saturday. Zacarias\n\ntestified that appellees wanted to discuss the contract further but felt \u201cpressure tactics\u201d\n\nwere being used with the promotion to get them to sign right away. He did not believe that\n\nany of the contract terms were negotiated with Tijerina, and they were not negotiated with\n\nhim. Zacarias testified that he did not consider the contract terms applicable to him.\n\nZacarias paid the deposit in cash and appellees received a receipt.\n\n       Over the course of several months, appellees made monthly $500 cash payments\n\nin accordance with their agreement. In November 2019, Tijerina asked to switch the\n\nwedding date due to her pregnancy due date. Appellants claim to have explained the\n\ncancellation policy in detail at that time, leading Tijerina to drop her request to change the\n\ndate. During this time, the parties also reached additional agreements for appellants to\n\nprovide further goods and services and appellees made payments for these new items.\n\nThe final addition was made on February 27, 2020. On February 28, 2020, Zacarias wrote\n\na check from his business account to appellants to pay the remaining balance owed of\n\n$16,075.\n\n       Afterwards, appellees became aware of the concerns surrounding the COVID-19\n\npandemic and approached appellants to discuss what would happen with the scheduled\n\n\n                                              4\n\freception date. Appellants\u2019 employee initially told appellees that they would lose their\n\nmoney if they cancelled the event or if appellants were forced to cancel the event.\n\nAppellees asked to reschedule, and appellants\u2019 employee said she would speak with\n\nSaida.\n\n         On or around March 17, 2020, Saida called appellees to notify them that the\n\nscheduled reception date would have to be cancelled due to COVID-19 and Hidalgo\n\nCounty orders requiring public events to be cancelled. Of import, Saida did not cancel the\n\nevent outright but instead offered to reschedule the reception date but only offered\n\nFridays, Sundays, or a weekday. Saida testified that at that time appellants had already\n\nordered tablecloths and vases for appellees\u2019 event, though admitted those items could be\n\nused for other events.\n\n         Tijerina testified she could not agree to those dates as they needed a Saturday for\n\nout-of-town guests to attend. Saida emailed to confirm that only Fridays were available in\n\n2020 and that appellees would lose all money under the contract if they did not agree to\n\none of those dates. Appellees asked for a refund which appellants refused to provide.\n\nAppellees then hired an attorney to write a demand letter, which was sent on April 9,\n\n2020.\n\n         Appellants sent a written response to the demand letter on April 10, 2020, claiming\n\nto have explained the contract in detail to appellees and describing the November 2019\n\nincident when Tijerina asked to switch the wedding date. The response also stated that\n\nthe offer to reschedule was only a courtesy because the contract entitled appellants to\n\ncancel the event without a refund or rescheduling a new date.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       On April 20, 2020, the parties agreed to reschedule the reception date to Saturday,\n\nFebruary 20, 2021. However, appellants required as a condition that appellees sign a\n\nletter stating \u201c[w]e agree and fully accept that the deposit and all payments given are not\n\nrefundable in accordance [with] the policy and signed contract at The Gala . . .\u201d Appellants\n\nalso sent a new contract to execute with this letter. Appellees refused to sign this letter or\n\nnew contract on their attorney\u2019s advice. According to Tijerina, Victor refused to change\n\ntheir reception date or refund their money if they did not sign the letter and new contract.\n\nAppellees\u2019 counsel proposed they amend the original contract to change the reception\n\ndate, but appellants refused that offer.1\n\n       The parties reached an impasse and litigation ensued. On October 16, 2020,\n\nappellees filed suit against appellants. Appellees filed their third amended petition on\n\nNovember 15, 2022, asserting causes of action for fraud, breach of contract, rescission,\n\nconversion, promissory estoppel, and for violations of the DTPA including multiple\n\n\u201claundry list\u201d violations and unconscionable acts.\n\n       A jury trial commenced on November 13, 2023. Tijerina testified that appellants\u2019\n\nrefusal to reschedule a reception date or refund their money caused her anguish and\n\nstress due to the worry about whether they would have a wedding reception or get their\n\nmoney back. She also testified that appellants never provided anything of value in\n\nexchange for the total amount paid of $19,575 and never incurred any costs preparing for\n\nappellees\u2019 reception. She conceded that she did not have to sign the contract. She also\n\nadmitted she could have chosen a different venue for her wedding reception. Tijerina\n\ntestified that she was offered a variety of options for services for the reception. Regarding\n\n\n       1 Appellees later married in December 2021 in Canc\u00fan, Mexico.\n\n\n                                                 6\n\fher experience with contracts, Tijerina stated she had familiarity with real estate contracts.\n\nAppellees\u2019 counsel testified regarding the proper amount of attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\n       Victor testified regarding ownership of The Gala building. He testified that he\n\nowned the building, though a K-1 tax form indicated that \u201cThe Gala Special Events, LTD\u201d\n\nwas the building\u2019s owner and that Victor was 99% owner of the company. He further\n\ntestified that his wife Saida was the primary decisionmaker and manager of the business.\n\nHe also stated that both parties to a contract should understand the details of the\n\nagreement. Victor said that the pandemic caused the cancellation of the May wedding\n\nreception, not any decision of appellants, and that they attempted to enter a \u201ctreaty for a\n\nchange\u201d to reschedule the reception date.\n\n       Saida testified that appellants made multiple attempts to accommodate a new date\n\nfor the reception after it was cancelled. She said The Gala changed the date three to four\n\ntimes without charging additional fees. Her opinion is that the original date was cancelled\n\ndue to the pandemic, not any fault of appellants or appellees. She testified that the\n\nbusiness\u2019s success depends on reserving dates and making money from each date.\n\n       However, Saida admitted on cross-examination that she initially told appellees in\n\nan email that if they rescheduled the reception date for 2021, appellees would lose all of\n\ntheir money. She agreed that her contract was \u201cone-sided\u201d in favor of The Gala but said\n\nshe did not apply the liquidated damages clause to appellees or any other customer.\n\nSaida asserted this was because dates were valuable to her business and if someone\n\nchanges their mind, then she loses income that she otherwise would have received for\n\nthat date. Saida also testified that though the contract stated the customer would lose all\n\ndeposits and payments if The Gala cancelled an event for any reason, it had to be a\n\n\n                                              7\n\f\u201cvalid\u201d reason for The Gala to take such extreme action. She again testified that she\n\nordered specific items for appellees\u2019 wedding reception, even though they could be\n\nreused for other events.\n\n        On November 16, 2023, the trial court partially granted appellants\u2019 motion for\n\ndirected verdict, dismissing appellees\u2019 claims for fraud, breach of contract, and\n\npromissory estoppel. The trial court also entered an order sua sponte declaring the\n\ncontract between the parties illusory and ordering that appellants return the contract sum\n\nto appellees.\n\n        On November 17, 2023, the jury reached a verdict finding that appellees were\n\nconsumers under the DTPA and that The Gala Special Events, Ltd. had engaged in\n\nunconscionable actions against appellees, which were a producing cause of their\n\ndamages. However, the jury found that appellants did not engage in knowing conduct and\n\ndid not commit any DTPA \u201claundry list\u201d violation. The jury awarded actual damages for\n\nthe total amount paid as well as attorney\u2019s fees for trial and appeal.\n\n        Appellants filed a JNOV and motion for new trial asserting a variety of arguments.\n\nThe trial court denied both motions and rendered final judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict on\n\nJanuary 3, 2024. This appeal followed.\n\n                                         II.      DISCUSSION\n\n        Appellants raise seven issues on appeal.2 There are two outcome-determinative\n\nissues that we address first.\n\n\n\n\n        2 Appellants\u2019 brief claims to advance nine distinct issues in the table of contents; however, only\n\nseven issues are briefed.\n                                                    8\n\fA.     Order Declaring Contract Illusory\n\n       On November 16, 2023, the trial court sua sponte entered an order declaring the\n\ncontract between the parties illusory and awarding appellees the contract amount. This\n\nwas based on the trial court finding that the contract provision allowing appellants to\n\nterminate the contract for any reason and keep all of appellees\u2019 deposits and payments\n\nfailed to bind appellants. Generally, contracts that lack mutuality of obligation and, thus,\n\nallow a promisor to discontinue performance without notice, are illusory. See Frequent\n\nFlyer Depot, Inc. v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d 215, 224 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2009,\n\npet. denied).\n\n       While the trial court\u2019s order did not specify the type of order it was, we treat it as\n\nan order granting directed verdict because the order entered a judgment on this issue as\n\na matter of law following the close of evidence at trial. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 268; Daniels v.\n\nAllsup\u2019s Convenience Stores, Inc., 604 S.W.3d 461, 465 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo 2020, pet.\n\ndenied). Specifically, we treat this as an order granting the equitable remedy of rescission\n\nof contract on appellees\u2019 breach of contract claim, as pleaded in the alternative, based on\n\nfinding the contract illusory. Entered almost simultaneously on November 16, 2023, was\n\nan order granting appellants\u2019 motion for directed verdict, which we treat as an order\n\ndenying the relief of monetary damages for breach of contract.\n\n       Appellants assert that the trial court erred in entering the sua sponte order because\n\nappellees\u2019 pleadings did not seek a declaration that the contract was illusory. We will\n\nexamine whether it was appropriate to grant directed verdict on this issue based on\n\nappellants\u2019 complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       1.     Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n       \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for directed verdict under a legal-\n\nsufficiency standard.\u201d Innovate Tech. Sols., L.P. v. Youngsoft, Inc., 418 S.W.3d 148, 151\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2013, no pet.). \u201cA directed verdict is proper when a defect in the\n\nopponent\u2019s pleadings makes them insufficient to support a judgment, the evidence\n\nconclusively proves the fact that establishes a party\u2019s right to judgment as a matter of law,\n\nor the evidence is insufficient to raise an issue of fact.\u201d Id. Questions of law, such as the\n\nlegal meaning of words, are reviewed de novo. In re Estate of Slaughter, 305 S.W.3d 804,\n\n808 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2010, no pet.). De novo review means we give no deference\n\nto the trial court\u2019s decision. Id. (citing Quick v. City of Austin, 7 S.W.3d 109, 116 (Tex.\n\n1998)). \u201cThe judgment of the court shall conform to the pleadings[.]\u201d TEX. R. CIV. P. 301.\n\nAny judgment must be supported by the parties\u2019 pleadings as \u201c[a] court\u2019s jurisdiction to\n\nrender judgment is invoked by the pleadings\u201d and without a corresponding pleading a\n\njudgment \u201cis erroneous.\u201d Moran v. Williamson, 498 S.W.3d 85, 93 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2016, pet. denied)).\n\n       \u201cRescission is merely the \u2018common, shorthand name\u2019 for the composite remedy of\n\nrescission and restitution.\u201d Cruz v. Andrews Restoration, Inc., 364 S.W.3d 817, 825 (Tex.\n\n2012). It is typically used as a substitute for monetary damages and thus a party seeking\n\nrescission must prevail on a claim for which rescission is a remedy. See Kennebrew v.\n\nHarris, 425 S.W.3d 588, 595 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. denied). It is an\n\nequitable remedy and generally disfavored and will only be granted when the relative\n\nequities clearly favor rescission. See Davis v. Estridge, 85 S.W.3d 308, 310 n.2 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Tyler 2001 pet. denied); see also Hart v. Besselman, No. 07-24-00219-CV, 2025\n\n\n                                             10\n\fWL 1561279, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Amarillo June 2, 2025, no pet. h.) (mem. op.).\n\n       This remedy \u201coperates to extinguish a contract that is legally valid but must be set\n\naside due to fraud, mistake, or some other reason to avoid unjust enrichment.\u201d Gentry v.\n\nSquires Constr., Inc., 188 S.W.3d 396, 410 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2006, no pet.). After\n\nrescission, \u201cthe rights and liabilities of the parties are extinguished, any consideration that\n\nwas paid is returned, and the parties are restored to their respective positions as if no\n\ncontract between them had ever existed.\u201d Ginn v. NCI Bldg. Sys., Inc., 472 S.W.3d 802,\n\n837 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.). The decision to grant rescission lies\n\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial court. Id.\n\n       \u201cA promise is illusory if it does not bind the promisor, such as when the promisor\n\nretains the option to discontinue performance.\u201d In re 24R, Inc., 324 S.W.3d 564, 567 (Tex.\n\n2010). If illusory promises are all that supports a purported contract, there is no mutuality\n\nof obligation and thus no contract. Id. Retaining the ability to terminate the agreement\n\nalone does not render it illusory, however, as a contract will still be enforceable if it\n\nguarantees prior notice to the other party before termination, and there is no retroactive\n\napplication of any cancellation provision. See Henry & Sons Constr. Co. v. Campos, 510\n\nS.W.3d 689, 694 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2016, pet. denied).\n\n       Furthermore, mutuality in each contract clause is not required if there is\n\nconsideration for the entire contract. Am. Airlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d at 224. \u201cThe test for\n\nmutuality is applied and determined when enforcement is sought, not when the promises\n\nare made.\u201d Id. If there is part performance by the promisee, then there can still be\n\nconsideration for an illusory contract. Id. at 224\u201325.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       2.     Was there a supportive pleading for the trial court\u2019s sua sponte order?\n\n       We first examine whether there is a supportive pleading seeking rescission of\n\ncontract based on an illusory promise. \u201cOur procedural rules merely require that the\n\npleadings provide fair notice of the claim and the relief sought such that the opposing\n\nparty can prepare a defense.\u201d Reaves v. City of Corpus Christi, 518 S.W.3d 594, 599\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg 2017, no pet.). Therefore, so long as the petition\n\n\u201cgives fair and adequate notice of the facts upon which the pleader bases his claim\u201d then\n\nthe petition will be held sufficient. Id. at 600. We must merely assess \u201cwhether an\n\nopposing party can ascertain from the pleading the nature of the controversy, its basic\n\nissues, and the type of evidence that might be relevant.\u201d Id. Appellants contend that\n\nappellees failed to raise this issue in their pleadings.\n\n       However, appellees\u2019 pleading did assert a \u201ccause of action\u201d for rescission due to\n\nfailure of consideration as an alternative to a standard breach of contract cause of action.\n\nAppellees described the contract as containing \u201can illusory promise\u201d as part of the\n\nbackground facts of their pleading and specifically stated in their alternative theory of\n\nrecovery that appellants would be unjustly enriched by failing to perform as agreed.\n\nAlthough there is no explicit request for a declaration that the contract should be\n\nrescinded, appellees\u2019 petition asserted that the contract was illusory and, based on the\n\nfailure of consideration, sought its rescission\u2014whether this is done through a \u201cfinding,\u201d\n\n\u201cruling\u201d or \u201cdeclaration\u201d is irrelevant because the remedy sought is restoring the parties to\n\ntheir initial positions. See id. at 599. Therefore, appellees\u2019 petition gave fair notice that\n\nappellees were seeking to void the contract and recover the balance paid to appellants.\n\nAppellants should have been able to ascertain from the face of the pleading that the\n\n\n                                              12\n\fnature of the controversy involved whether the contract should be subject to rescission\n\nbecause the promises contained therein were alleged to not have been mutually binding.\n\nSee id. at 600. Therefore, the trial court had authority to grant a directed verdict and\n\nprovide relief in the form of rescission of contract, which, consequently, would place the\n\nparties in the same position in which they were before the contract was signed. See\n\nMoran, 498 S.W.3d at 93.\n\n       3.     Was the contract illusory?\n\n       We next examine whether the contract was illusory, in support of a finding of\n\nrescission. The key provision reads \u201c[(]1) If the client cancels or rebooks the date or [T]he\n\nGala terminates for any reason the scheduled special event, the client loses automatically\n\nall deposits, security deposit[,] and any other payments made up to the date of the\n\ncancellation or termination.\u201d This provision as written permits appellants to terminate the\n\nagreement \u201cfor any reason\u201d and causes appellees to lose all money paid for their event\n\neven if by no fault of their own. Because appellants can terminate the contract for any\n\nreason and are not obligated to return any money, this contract \u201cdoes not bind the\n\npromisor\u201d as appellants are able to terminate performance at any time for any reason.\n\nSee In re 24R, Inc., 324 S.W.3d at 567. While appellants reference other cases involving\n\ncancellation provisions, the cancellation provision here does not require any advance\n\nnotice of cancellation to appellees and applies retroactively to allow appellants to keep all\n\nmonies paid to them for the event, regardless of whether they perform. See Campos, 510\n\nS.W.3d at 694. Therefore, the provision at issue lacks mutuality of obligation and is not\n\nenforceable. See In re 24R, Inc., 324 S.W.3d at 567.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f       We must examine mutuality at the time enforcement is sought, rather than when\n\nthe promises were made. Am. Airlines, Inc., 281 S.W.3d at 224. Appellants argue that at\n\nthe time of enforcement they did not enforce the contract provision as written and offered\n\nto reschedule the reception date after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of\n\nthe initial date. The record does indicate that the parties initially agreed to a rescheduled\n\nwedding reception date, but that there were disputes about executing a further contract\n\nand waiver of right to refund. While this conduct leaves the record a mixed bag, of import,\n\nthe record indicates that appellants to date have not returned the contract sum and\n\nreferenced the cancellation provision at issue as justification for not returning the money.\n\nRegardless of the true reason for the rescheduled date not moving forward, appellants\n\nkept the amounts paid, did not provide a wedding reception to appellees, and relied on\n\nthe cancellation provision at the time enforcement was sought. See id. Therefore, this\n\nprovision lacks mutuality which renders rescission an appropriate remedy; it would be\n\ninequitable and unjust enrichment to allow appellants to keep the contract amount after\n\nthe failure of consideration. See Gentry, 188 S.W.3d at 410; Davis, 85 S.W.3d at 310 n.2;\n\nHart, 2025 WL 1561279, at *1.\n\n       Appellants urge in the alternative that, if the Court finds the contract provision\n\nillusory, such provision is severable and the contract should otherwise be enforceable.\n\nCourts can generally sever an illegal or an unenforceable provision from a contract and\n\nenforce the remainder of the contract \u201cso long as it does not constitute the essential\n\npurpose of the agreement.\u201d In re Poly-Am., L.P., 262 S.W.3d 337, 360 (Tex. 2008);\n\nCouns. Fin. Servs., L.L.C. v. Leibowitz, No. 13-12-00103-CV, 2013 WL 3895331, at *9\n\n(Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi\u2013Edinburg July 25, 2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.). We\n\n\n                                             14\n\fexamine whether the parties would have entered into the agreement absent the\n\nunenforceable provisions and if the provision was a \u201cmain or essential\u201d purpose of the\n\nagreement or if it was just one of the many promises made. In re Poly-Am., 262 S.W.3d\n\nat 360.\n\n       The primary purpose of the subject agreement was for appellants to secure a date\n\nand provide a wedding reception at their venue on that date in exchange for the monetary\n\npayment by appellees. As Saida testified, the cancellation provision was included in the\n\ncontract because dates were important to her business and helped prevent financial loss\n\nthat would otherwise occur by booking a date that could not be provided to other\n\ncustomers. Therefore, the provision was an essential part of the primary agreement as a\n\nmechanism to help ensure that the event moved forward on the scheduled date. Absent\n\nthe provision, the contract\u2019s primary purpose of securing a date for a particular event is\n\nthwarted and thus the entire contract must be held unenforceable. See id.\n\n       Further, even if the provision was severable, the provision is appellants\u2019 entire\n\nbasis for withholding return of the prior paid amounts. As this provision is illusory, the prior\n\npaid amounts should be returned to appellees regardless of whether this provision is\n\nseverable as appellants have no other legal basis for refusing to return appellees\u2019 money.\n\n       Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded the contract was illusory and that\n\nappellees were entitled to rescission and the refund of the contract amount. We overrule\n\nappellants\u2019 issue seven.\n\nB.     DTPA\n\n       The jury found appellants engaged in an unconscionable action under the DTPA\n\nand awarded damages accordingly.

While\n\nappellants assert a variety of arguments, central to the resolution of these issues is\n\nwhether there was sufficient evidence to find appellants liable for having committed an\n\nunconscionable act. Accordingly, we must determine if the verdict is supported by\n\nsufficient evidence.\n\n        1.

A \u201cplaintiff must show that there is\n\nsome unbroken causal connection between the allegedly deceptive act and the actual\n\ndamages suffered.\u201d Bartlett, 33 S.W.3d at 39. If the defendant proves there is a new and\n\nindependent basis for the injuries, this may negate that the defendant\u2019s acts were the\n\nproducing cause of the injury. Id.\n\n       2.     Analysis\n\n       In their live pleading, appellees asserted that the unconscionable act or course of\n\naction was that appellants \u201cknew\u201d the contract contained an illusory promise and that\n\nappellees executed a contract for an event that appellants could cancel at any time for\n\nany reason. Appellees also asserted that the refund waiver language was\n\n\u201cinconspicuous,\u201d and that failing to disclose the illusory promise before appellees signed\n\nthe contract was unconscionable. Similarly, appellees asserted at trial that it was\n\nunconscionable for the contract\u2019s cancellation policy to not comply with the DTPA waiver\n\nrequirements. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 17.42.\n\n       First, the contract did not violate \u00a7 17.42. That statute only relates to a contract\n\nprovision waiving the consumer\u2019s rights to bring a DTPA action. See id. Appellants do not\n\nassert that appellees waived their right to bring a DTPA action, as evidenced throughout\n\nthe record. A refund or cancellation contract provision does not have to comply with\n\n\u00a7 17.42 and thus the failure to follow this provision is legally insufficient to prove an\n\n\n                                            19\n\funconscionable act. See id.; see also Katy Int\u2019l, 451 S.W.3d at 82.\n\n      The parties dispute whether the no-refund language was conspicuous, the relative\n\nknowledge of both parties, and whether such language renders a contract inherently\n\nillusory. Appellants argue that cancellation policies that do not provide refunds are\n\ncommon. While the contract language is troubling, we do not reach the issue of whether\n\ninclusion of such language in a contract constitutes an unconscionable act as appellees\n\nfailed to demonstrate that the presence of such language was the producing cause of\n\nappellees\u2019 damages. See Daugherty, 187 S.W.3d at 617.\n\n      While appellees pled that appellants\u2019 failure to disclose the contract language was\n\nthe cause of their actual damages, the evidence at trial did not demonstrate that the mere\n\npresence of such language in the contract almost a year prior to the event\u2019s cancellation\n\ncaused them damages. See Katy Int\u2019l, 451 S.W.3d at 82. The undisputed evidence in the\n\nrecord established that the original May 2020 wedding date was cancelled because of the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the unfortunate resultant orders from Hidalgo County that\n\ninterfered with businesses and the conduct of commerce. Both parties conceded multiple\n\ntimes throughout trial that the only reason the wedding reception did not proceed on the\n\noriginal date was because the county issued orders that forced appellant to close its\n\nvenue to public events, not because appellants decided to cancel the event for any reason\n\nas, presumably, the cancellation policy would allow them to do. This constitutes evidence\n\nof a superseding event that was the cause of damages to appellees. See Daugherty, 187\n\nS.W.3d at 617.\n\n      Furthermore, under Texas law, \u201cone who signs an agreement, even without\n\nknowledge of its contents, is presumed to have consented to its terms and is charged\n\n\n                                           20\n\fwith knowledge of the agreement\u2019s legal effect.\u201d McGonagle v. Stewart Title Guar. Co.,\n\n432 S.W.3d 535, 541 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2014, pet. denied). Because Tijerina signed the\n\ncontract, she is charged with knowledge of the contract\u2019s terms, including the allegedly\n\nunconscionable provisions. Id. Therefore, this also constitutes evidence of a superseding\n\ncause regarding any allegations that appellants\u2019 failure to advise them of the contract\n\nterms was unconscionable because Tijerina is deemed to have been aware of the\n\ncancellation provision at the time she signed the contract. Id.; Daugherty, 187 S.W.3d at\n\n617.\n\n       There is testimony regarding the parties reaching an agreement to reschedule the\n\nreception date to February 2021, and appellees make much of appellants\u2019 actions\n\nfollowing the cancellation of the event. But appellees did not plead or argue at trial that\n\nthe failure of the rescheduled event to occur was the cause of their actual damages, nor\n\nthat their subsequent activity and the requirement to enter a new contract and waive\n\nliability or damages under the existing contract was the cause of their damages. Instead,\n\nappellees were focused on appellants\u2019 failure to issue a refund based on the contract\n\nlanguage. As such, even assuming appellants\u2019 actions after the Hidalgo County orders\n\ncanceled the event could be considered unconscionable, this evidence is legally\n\ninsufficient because neither this Court nor the trial court can consider evidence not in\n\nconformity with the pleadings. See Moran, 498 S.W.3d at 93; Katy Int\u2019l, 451 S.W.3d at 82.\n\n       Appellees failed to demonstrate there was an unbroken causal connection\n\nbetween the alleged unconscionable act, the presence of an inconspicuous \u201cillusory\u201d\n\ncancellation provision of a contract executed in 2019, and appellees\u2019 damages. Bartlett,\n\n33 S.W.3d at 39. During oral argument, appellees were unable to identify the producing\n\n\n                                            21\n\fcause of damages. As there is a complete absence of this vital fact, i.e., the producing\n\ncause, the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict is legally insufficient and the trial court\n\nerred by denying appellants\u2019 motion for JNOV. See Katy Intern, 451 S.W.3d at 82;\n\nPlayboy Enters., 359 S.W.3d at 328. We sustain appellants\u2019 first issue.\n\nC.     Attorney\u2019s Fees\n\n       As we have held that JNOV should be entered in favor of appellants on the DTPA\n\nunconscionability claim, appellees are not entitled to recovery of attorney\u2019s fees regarding\n\nthat claim. They are also not entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees by prevailing on the issue\n\nof rescission. While rescission is a recovery under a breach of contract theory, to recover\n\nattorney\u2019s fees for breach of contract, a party must \u201crecover damages.\u201d Kennebrew, 425\n\nS.W.3d at 600. Appellees have not recovered damages despite the return of the prior\n\npaid amounts as the effect of rescission is to undo the instrument and put the parties in\n\nthe position before the contract was executed. See In re Devon Energy Prod. Co., 312\n\nS.W.3d 778, 784 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler 2010, no pet.). Thus, appellees are not entitled to\n\nrecovery of attorney\u2019s fees. See Am. Apparel Products, Inc. v. Brabs, Inc., 880 S.W.2d\n\n267, 270 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ).\n\n       We therefore sustain appellants\u2019 issues four and five in part and overrule those\n\nissues in part.\n\n                                    III.   CONCLUSION\n\n       We conclude that JNOV should be entered in favor of appellants, we need not\n\naddress appellants\u2019 issues three and six. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1. We uphold the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s order finding the contract illusory and affirm the judgment in part and its award of\n\nthe remedy of rescission and the sum of $19,575 in favor of appellees. We reverse and\n\n\n                                             22\n\frender judgment in part in favor of appellants regarding appellees\u2019 claims for DTPA\n\nunconscionability. We find that each party should bear their own costs and attorney\u2019s\n\nfees.\n\n                                                          YSMAEL D.

We conditionally\n\ngrant the petition for writ of mandamus.\n\n                                            I.      BACKGROUND\n\n        The underlying lawsuit concerns the assignment of fourteen oil and gas leases\n\ncovering 633.22 acres in La Salle County. To effectuate the assignment, real party in\n\ninterest Texas Lone Star Petroleum Corporation (Lone Star) and Empresa Energy, LLC\n\n(Empresa)2 entered into two contracts: a \u201cPurchase and Sale Agreement\u201d (PSA) and a\n\n\u201cPartial Assignment of Oil, Gas, and Mineral Leases with Reservation of Overriding\n\nRoyalty Interest and Reversionary Rights\u201d (Assignment). The Assignment contains a\n\nvenue selection clause which provides that \u201c[v]enue for any cause of action pertaining to\n\nthis Assignment or the interests assigned or reserved by this Assignment shall lie\n\nexclusively in Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas.\u201d3\n\n        In the PSA, Lone Star agreed to assign the leases to Empresa, and Empresa\n\nagreed to pay Lone Star $850.00 per acre for 633.22 acres for the total sum of $538,237\n\n\n\n       2 Empresa has not answered or otherwise appeared in the underlying lawsuit or this original\n\nproceeding.\n        3 The PSA contains a similar venue selection clause which provides that \u201c[v]enue for any cause of\n\naction relating to this agreement or the documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall lie exclusively\nin Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Texas.\u201d\n\n                                                     2\n\fas the purchase price. In the Assignment, Lone Star transferred its interests in the leases\n\nto Empresa \u201cfor ten dollars ([$]10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.\u201d The\n\nAssignment granted Lone Star contingent reversionary rights to the leases if, for instance,\n\nEmpresa failed to drill a well according to certain specifications on lease acreage, or if\n\nEmpresa\u2019s wells did not satisfy certain production levels. If such an instance occurred,\n\nthen Lone Star could terminate the Assignment, and Empresa was required to reassign\n\nits interests back to Lone Star.\n\n          Thereafter, Empresa assigned seven of the fourteen leases to Chesapeake\n\nExploration, which conveyed some interests to CNOOC. Chesapeake Operating then\n\nformed two pooled units that included portions of the leases and commenced drilling.\n\nLater, Chesapeake Exploration assigned its interests in the seven leases to INEOS.\n\nINEOS began drilling wells for itself and as operator for CNOOC, and Jamestown also\n\nbegan drilling wells.\n\n          On January 7, 2025, Lone Star filed suit against relators and Empresa in Nueces\n\nCounty alleging that the case involved a \u201cmajor transaction,\u201d and, thus, the venue\n\nselection clause in the Assignment provided for mandatory venue in Nueces County. See\n\nid. \u00a7 15.020. Lone Star alleged that some of the wells that had been drilled failed to satisfy\n\nthe production levels required by the Assignment, thereby triggering Lone Star\u2019s right to\n\ntake over the ownership and operation of the wells and associated proration units.\n\nAccordingly, Lone Star alleged that it possessed equitable title to the wells and acreage,\n\nand it sought, inter alia, specific performance of the Assignment to enforce its ownership\n\nrights.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       Subsequently, relators filed separate motions to transfer venue arguing that the\n\nvenue selection clause was unenforceable because the PSA and Assignment did not\n\ninvolve a \u201cmajor transaction,\u201d and that venue was mandatory in La Salle County where\n\nthe wells and proration units are located. Lone Star filed a response to the motions to\n\ntransfer venue, and in support of its response and position that the lawsuit involved a\n\nmajor transaction, presented the amended affidavit of Jeffrey D. Cobbs, the President of\n\nLone Star, who testified in relevant part that:\n\n       (a)    The [Assignment] was signed as part of and together with the PSA\n              and the [Assignment] and all obligations contained in the\n              [Assignment] are made part of the PSA. The PSA and [Assignment]\n              were parts of a single transaction for the purchase, sale[,] and\n              development of the Subject Leases.\n\n       (b)    The PSA required Empresa to pay [Lone Star] $538,237 cash, and\n              to agree to perform the obligations under the [Assignment], all of\n              which are part of the consideration paid for the PSA and the\n              [Assignment]. The dollar amount of [the consideration] paid under\n              the PSA was not stated in the [Assignment] because the parties did\n              not want to publicly disclose the commercial terms of the transaction\n              in a recorded document.\n\n       (c)    Article XVII of the [Assignment] contains an express obligation for\n              the Assignee to drill wells to the depths covered by the [Assignment],\n              that a reasonable and prudent operator would drill under the same\n              or similar circumstances. This provision obligated the Assignee to\n              drill one or more wells to the Eagle Ford formation. Chesapeake and\n              INEOS, as assignees of Empresa, did actually drill multiple wells to\n              the Eagle Ford formation, on the acreage covered by the\n              [Assignment].\n\n       (d)    The Assignee\u2019s obligation to drill such wells was an important part of\n              the \u201cother good and valuable consideration\u201d exchanged for the\n              [Assignment], and if Assignee had failed to drill such a well before\n              the leases terminate, the penalty was termination of Assignee\u2019s rights\n              and reassignment to [Lone Star]. Based on the PSA, the value of the\n              acreage that would be lost by the Assignee for failure to drill was at\n              least $538,474.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       (e)    On January 22, 2010, the date of the [Assignment], the cost to drill\n              and the value of an Eagle Ford well was far in excess of $1 million.\n              On the first well alone, the Broken Arrow Ranch Unit C LAS 2H Well,\n              Chesapeake\u2019s authority for expenditure was $11,311,600 . . . .\n\n       (f)    In June of the year 2010, [Empresa] sold and assigned seven (7) of\n              the Subject Leases to [Chesapeake Exploration]. Chesapeake later\n              bought seven (7) replacement leases covering lands that had\n              originally been part of the [Assignment]. The seven Subject Leases\n              and the replacement leases are all covered by the [Assignment].\n\n       (g)    But for the [Assignment], Chesapeake and INEOS would not have\n              drilled the C2H Well or expended the monetary amounts they did\n              drilling this and other wells. The expenditure of these well costs were\n              an important part of the value agreed to under the [Assignment].\n\n       (h)    The obligation to drill is stated in the [Assignment], and all parties\n              were aware of and agreed to this consideration at the time it was\n              signed in 2010. Its value to the parties was known and understood\n              by both [Lone Star] and by [Empresa.]\n\n       (i)    The penalty for Assignee\u2019s failure to drill an Eagle Ford well is\n              termination of the [Assignment] and reassigning the acreage to [Lone\n              Star]. The loss of this acreage would have the agreed value of\n              $538,237, as agreed in the PSA. The combined value of the initial\n              Purchase Price and the value of the lost acreage is $1,076,474.00.\n\n       (j)    The parties to the [Assignment] agreed and understood that the\n              Assignee would be required to expend the cost of drilling an Eagle\n              Ford Shale well, at a cost in excess of $1 million, or lose the purchase\n              price and the acreage value, for a combined value of $1,076,474.00.\n              In either event, the Assignee is obligated to expend more than $1\n              million as consideration for the transaction evidenced by the\n              [Assignment].\n\n       (k)    The [Assignment] contains a paragraph that requires venue of any\n              cause of action pertaining to the [Assignment] or any of the interests\n              assigned or reserved in the [Assignment to] lie exclusively in Nueces\n              County, Texas.\n\nRelators filed a reply to Lone Star\u2019s response, and they further filed objections to Cobb\u2019s\n\namended affidavit and a motion to exclude the amended affidavit. On April 30, 2025, the\n\ntrial court held a hearing on relator\u2019s motions to transfer venue and the related evidentiary\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fmatters. On May 9, 2025, the trial court signed orders denying relators\u2019 motions to transfer\n\nvenue, overruling their objections to Cobb\u2019s affidavit, and denying their motion to exclude\n\nCobb\u2019s affidavit.\n\n       This original proceeding ensued. By two issues, relators assert that: (1) Lone\n\nStar\u2019s action does not arise from a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d because its \u201caggregate stated\n\nvalue\u201d falls below the minimum required by \u00a7 15.020; and (2) venue is mandatory in La\n\nSalle County under \u00a7 15.011 because Lone Star asserts equitable and legal title to oil and\n\ngas wells and proration units located there. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 15.020, 15.011. We have requested\n\nand received a response to the petition for writ of mandamus from Lone Star and a reply\n\nthereto from relators. See TEX. R. APP. P. 52.4, 52.5, 52.8.\n\n                                     II.     MANDAMUS\n\n       A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy available only when the trial court\n\nclearly abused its discretion and the party seeking relief lacks an adequate remedy on\n\nappeal.

Grocery Co., 492\n\nS.W.3d 300, 302 (Tex. 2016) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam); Walker v. Packer, 827\n\nS.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992) (orig. proceeding).\n\n       Generally, venue rulings may only be reviewed on appeal from the final judgment\n\nin the case. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.064(a) (prohibiting interlocutory\n\nappeals of venue determinations); TEX. R. CIV. P. 87.6 (same). However, mandamus relief\n\nis appropriate to enforce mandatory venue provisions. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 15.0642 (\u201cA party may apply for a writ of mandamus with an appellate court to\n\nenforce the mandatory venue provisions of this chapter.\u201d); Wagner v. Apache Corp., 627\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fS.W.3d 277, 288 (Tex. 2021) (stating that \u201cinterlocutory review of a trial court\u2019s failure to\n\nenforce a mandatory venue provision is available only through a writ of mandamus\u201d).\n\n                                       III.    VENUE\n\n       The plaintiff makes the initial choice of venue. Fortenberry v. Great Divide Ins., 664\n\nS.W.3d 807, 811 (Tex. 2023); In re Fox River Real Est. Holdings, Inc., 596 S.W.3d 759,\n\n762 (Tex. 2020) (orig. proceeding). A defendant may challenge a plaintiff\u2019s chosen venue\n\nby filing a motion to transfer. TEX. R. CIV. P. 86\u201387; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\u00a7 15.063. If a defendant challenges the plaintiff\u2019s venue choice by filing a timely motion\n\nto transfer venue, the plaintiff then bears the burden to present prima facie proof that\n\nvenue is maintainable in the county of suit, while the defendant bears the burden to prove\n\nvenue is maintainable in the county to which the transfer is sought. Fortenberry, 664\n\nS.W.3d at 811; In re Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, 711 S.W.3d 732, 738 (Tex.

LONE STAR\u2019S VENUE CHOICE: \u00a7 15.020\n\n       In their first issue, relators assert that the venue-selection clause in the Assignment\n\nis not enforceable because the aggregate stated value of the transaction at issue is below\n\nthe million-dollar requirement contained in the \u201cmajor transaction\u201d venue provision. See\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020. In support of their contention, they contend\n\nthat the PSA reflects a payment of $538,237, and the Assignment reflects a payment of\n\n\u201cten dollars (10.00) and other good and valuable consideration.\u201d Lone Star argues, in\n\ncontrast, that the PSA and Assignment comprise a major transaction because, in addition\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fto these sums, the Assignment required the assignees to either drill a well at a cost of\n\nmore than $1 million or reassign the property at issue to Lone Star with a stipulated value\n\nof $538,237.\n\nA.    Applicable Law\n\n      Venue selection clauses are generally unenforceable unless the contract\n\nconstitutes a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d under \u00a7 15.020 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\nIn re Grp. 1 Realty, Inc., 441 S.W.3d 469, 472 (Tex.

Section 15.020 provides:\n\n      (a)      In this section, \u201cmajor transaction\u201d means a transaction evidenced by\n               a written agreement under which a person pays or receives, or is\n               obligated to pay or entitled to receive, consideration with an\n               aggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million.

App.\u2014Tyler June 29, 2018, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). In determining the\n\naggregate stated value of the consideration in the transaction, we may consider separate\n\ninstruments. See Rieder v. Woods, 603 S.W.3d 86, 94\u201395 (Tex. 2020) (summarizing the\n\nlaw regarding the analysis of instruments pertaining to the same transaction); SM Energy\n\nCo. v. Union Pac. R.R., 652 S.W.3d 830, 840 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 2022, pet. denied)\n\n(considering a lease and wire transfer together to determine that the claim met the\n\naggregate stated value required by \u00a7 15.020); Hughes v. Pearcy, No. 03-10-00319-CV,\n\n2014 WL 7014353, at *2 (Tex. App.\u2014Austin Dec. 8, 2014, pet. denied) (mem. op)\n\n(concluding that a claim evidenced by four written agreements, construed together, did\n\nnot meet the aggregate stated value required by \u00a7 15.020).\n\n      The Texas Supreme Court has addressed how to determine the \u201caggregate stated\n\nvalue\u201d of the consideration in an agreement for purposes of \u00a7 15.020. See In re Tex. Ass\u2019n\n\nof Sch. Bds., Inc., 169 S.W.3d 653, 657\u201360 (Tex. 2005) (orig. proceeding). In that case,\n\nthe supreme court considered a venue selection provision in an agreement wherein the\n\nrelators agreed to provide more than $17 million in risk coverage for a cost of $41,973.\n\nId. at 654. The parties disagreed regarding whether the aggregated stated value of the\n\nconsideration was determined by using the risk coverage amount, $17 million, or the\n\namount paid for the coverage, $41,973. Id. at 657. In deciding this issue, the supreme\n\ncourt considered that the risk coverage agreement was an aleatory contract, that is, \u201ca\n\ncontract in which a promise is conditioned on the happening of a fortuitous event, [or] an\n\nevent of chance.\u201d Id. at 658. The court explained that insurance premiums are a function\n\nof calculated risk, and once risk has attached the premiums have been earned and are\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fgenerally non-returnable. Id. at 659. Reasoning that \u201cthe consideration to be valued is the\n\nundertaking of the risk that insured losses might occur,\u201d the supreme court concluded that\n\n\u201c[t]he aggregate stated value of the consideration for the coverage agreement is the\n\namount of the contribution specified in the agreement for assumption of the risk of loss\n\nfrom the enumerated perils, not the coverage limits.\u201d Id. at 659. The supreme court thus\n\ndetermined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to enforce the\n\ncontractual venue selection provision in the risk coverage agreement under \u00a7 15.020. Id.\n\nB.     Analysis\n\n       Relators assert that this case does not involve a major transaction because the\n\nvalue of the consideration stated in the PSA and Assignment combined is less than $1\n\nmillion. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020(a). In contrast, Lone Star\n\nexplains that:\n\n       Under the [Assignment], the Assignee had two choices: (a) drill an Eagle\n       Ford Shale well as required in Article XVII of the [Assignment] at a cost in\n       excess of $1 million; or (b) suffer the penalty for failure to drill under Article\n       V. Paragraph A of the [Assignment], which, combined with the original\n       purchase price set forth in the PSA, had a value of $1,076,474. In either\n       event, the Assignee would be obligated to expend a stated value in excess\n       of $1 million.\n\n       This Court must consider the value of the drilling commitment in the\n       [Assignment] together with the purchase price stated in the PSA. Such a\n       review unavoidably leads to the conclusion that the transaction underlying:\n       (a) the purchase price in the PSA; (b) the obligation to drill under the\n       [Assignment]; and (c) the value of the penalty for failure to drill, clearly\n       constitutes a single \u201cmajor transaction\u201d as provided in \u00a7 15.020. Under any\n       scenario, the value of consideration for this transaction exceeds the $1\n       million threshold under \u00a7 15.020(a), and thus the venue selection clause\n       would be applicable under \u00a7 15.020(b).\n\n(Record citations omitted). Lone Star thus alleges that we must extrapolate the amount\n\nof the consideration at issue based on the ramifications of the agreement, and it further\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fasserts that the trial court was entitled to consider Cobb\u2019s amended affidavit as extrinsic\n\nevidence in support of its valuation.\n\n       As stated previously, \u00a7 15.020 defines a \u201cmajor transaction\u201d subject to mandatory\n\nvenue in the county specified by agreement as \u201ca transaction evidenced by a written\n\nagreement under which a person pays or receives, or is obligated to pay or entitled to\n\nreceive, consideration with an aggregate stated value equal to or greater than $1 million.\u201d\n\nId. \u00a7 15.020(a). We determine the proper construction of this statute \u201cusing well-\n\nestablished statutory-construction principles and a plain-language approach. In re Fox\n\nRiver Real Est. Holdings, Inc., 596 S.W.3d at 763.\n\n       Based on the plain terms of the statute, the value of the consideration must be\n\nspecifically \u201cstated\u201d in the agreement. See id.; see also In re Togs Energy, Inc., No. 05-\n\n09-01018-CV, 2009 WL 3260910, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas Oct. 13, 2009, orig.\n\nproceeding) (mem. op.) (\u201cUnder [\u00a7] 15.020(a), the parties\u2019 agreement must contain the\n\naggregate stated value of the consideration. Because the Settlement and Release\n\nAgreement does not contain this information, it fails to qualify as a \u2018major\u2019 transaction\n\nunder [\u00a7] 15.020.\u201d). Further, we do not consider contingent or prospective amounts in\n\ndetermining the aggregate stated value of the consideration. See In re Tex. Ass\u2019n of Sch.\n\nBds., Inc., 169 S.W.3d at 658\u201359; see also NGL Water Sols. Permian, LLC, 2025 Tex.\n\nBus. 20, at \u00b6 19, 2025 WL 1445867, at *4 (concluding that an agreement did not evidence\n\na major transaction where it \u201cstate[d] no value\u201d and \u201cany potential consideration was\n\nconditioned on several events that never occurred); Devon Energy Corp. v. Iona Energy,\n\nL.P., No. 02-19-00343-CV, 2020 WL 98138, at *4 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth Jan. 9, 2020,\n\npet. denied) (mem. op.) (concluding that \u00a7 15.020 requires the aggregate value to be\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\fstated on the face of the agreement and that the aggregate value is not determined\n\nprospectively); Hughes, 2014 WL 7014353, at *3 (concluding that agreements providing\n\nfor payments contingent upon future sales and a future election to purchase did not\n\nsupport venue under \u00a7 15.020).\n\n       Despite the foregoing, Lone Star argues that the relators\u2019 \u201csimplistic attempt to limit\n\n\u00a7 15.020 to the dollar amount shown on the face of one of the agreements is at odds with\n\nthe case law applying \u00a7 15.020.\u201d In support of its contention, Lone Star cites In re Group\n\n1 Realty, Inc., 441 S.W.3d 469, and In re Royalco Oil & Gas Corp., 287 S.W.3d 398. Lone\n\nStar asserts that in Group 1, the purchase price for certain option agreements was not\n\nstated in the agreement but was later determined by appraisal, yet \u201cthe court held that the\n\ntransaction in that case was governed by \u00a7 15.020, even though the dollar value was not\n\nexpressly \u2018stated\u2019 in the agreement.\u201d We disagree with Lone Star\u2019s characterization of\n\nGroup 1. In Group 1, the parties disagreed regarding which of two mandatory venue\n\nstatutes applied to the parties\u2019 dispute, and the court held that \u00a7 15.020 \u201cclearly controls.\u201d\n\nIn re Grp. 1 Realty, Inc., 441 S.W.3d at 473. In so ruling, the court noted that \u201c[n]either\n\nparty contests that the [agreement] constitutes a major transaction under [\u00a7] 15.020,\u201d and\n\n\u201c[a]s such, we need not decide the issue.\u201d Id. at 474 n.5.\n\n       Lone Star similarly asserts that In re Royalco supports its contention that the value\n\nof the consideration need not be stated in the agreement to support mandatory venue\n\nunder \u00a7 15.020. See generally In re Royalco Oil & Gas Corp., 287 S.W.3d 398. There,\n\nthe court considered whether a saltwater disposal lease agreement constituted a major\n\ntransaction. Id. at 399. That court considered that the lease had a 99-year fixed term and\n\nrequired monthly rental payments of $20,000, so \u201cthe lease would require the payment of\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f$1 million in rentals in less than five years.\u201d Id. at 400. The court thus concluded that \u201cthe\n\nlease constitutes a \u2018major transaction\u2019 for purposes of [\u00a7] 15.020 because it provides for\n\nthe payment of \u2018consideration with an aggregate stated value\u2019 of more than $1 million.\u201d\n\nId. at 400\u201301. Lonestar concedes; however, that \u201c[t]he court did the math\u201d in reaching its\n\nconclusion.\n\n       Here the PSA and Assignment do not provide for consideration with \u201can aggregate\n\nstated value equal to or greater than $1 million,\u201d and we cannot consider an uncertain,\n\nprospective cost (or loss) as part of consideration for the agreement. Accordingly,\n\n\u00a7 15.020 does not apply. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.020(a), (b); In re\n\nTex. Ass\u2019n of Sch. Boards, Inc., 169 S.W.3d at 658\u201359; see also NGL Water Sols.\n\nPermian, LLC, 2025 Tex.

We reject Lone Star\u2019s contentions otherwise.\n\nC.     Summary\n\n       We conclude that Lone Star failed to meet its burden to show that its lawsuit was\n\nbased on a major transaction rendering venue mandatory in Nueces County. See TEX.\n\nCIV.

RELATORS\u2019 VENUE CHOICE: \u00a7 15.011\n\n       In their second issue, relators contend that venue should be transferred to La Salle\n\nCounty based on mandatory venue pertaining to land because Lone Star asserts\n\nequitable and legal title to oil and gas wells and proration units located there. See TEX.\n\nCIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 15.011. Lone Star asserts that \u00a7 15.020 regarding major\n\ntransactions takes precedence over \u00a7 15.011, see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f\u00a7 15.020(c); In re Fisher, 433 S.W.3d at 534, but does not otherwise contend that \u00a7 15.011\n\nis inapplicable.

It is undisputed that\n\nthe property at issue in this original proceeding is in La Salle County.\n\n       We examine the \u201cessence\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d of a dispute to determine whether it falls\n\nwithin \u00a7 15.011. See In re Applied Chem. Magnesias Corp., 206 S.W.3d 114, 119 (Tex.\n\n2006) (orig. proceeding) (\u201cessence\u201d); Yzaguirre v. KCS Res., Inc., 53 S.W.3d 368, 371\n\n(Tex. 2001) (\u201csubstance\u201d). We determine the essence or substance of a suit by examining\n\n\u201cthe facts alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s petition, the rights asserted, and the relief sought.\u201d In re\n\nSignorelli Co., 446 S.W.3d 470, 474 (Tex.

If \u00a7 15.011 applies to one of Lone Star\u2019s claims or causes of action, then all\n\n\u201cclaims or causes of action arising from the same transaction, occurrence, or series of\n\ntransactions or occurrences\u201d must be brought in the county of mandatory venue. TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM.

Lone Star stated that, under the\n\nAssignment, it had \u201ca preferential right to take over ownership and operation of all wells\n\nin the event certain conditions occur.\u201d Lone Star explained that the Assignment required\n\nthe assignee to produce two barrels of oil per day per well; that relators breached the\n\nAssignment by failing to meet this requirement; and that relators\u2019 failure triggered Lone\n\nStar\u2019s \u201ctake-over right.\u201d Among other forms of relief sought, Lone Star requested the trial\n\ncourt to award it \u201cownership and operation of the C-2H Well together with the oil and gas\n\nleases covering the proration unit of 440 acres\u201d and \u201cownership and operation of the D-\n\n5H Well together with the oil and gas leases covering the proration unit of 480 acres.\u201d In\n\nthe alternative, Lone Star requested the trial court to impose constructive trusts on\n\nrelators\u2019 interests in these properties.\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Lone Star\u2019s lawsuit constitutes an action\n\nfor the recovery of an interest in real property under \u00a7 15.011.

After purchasing the range, Plaintiffs\u2019 house tragically burned \n18  down.  Months later, after Plaintiffs received notice of a voluntary recall regarding the \n19  electric range, they suspected the product caused the fire and filed suit for products \n20  liability, negligence, and breach of warranty.  Because they brought action in state \n21  court, Plaintiffs completed a form complaint and attached just five sentences of factual \n22  allegations.  Defendants removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, \n23  and they now jointly move to dismiss all claims, arguing that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the \n24  federal pleading standard.  The Court agrees and therefore GRANTS Defendants\u2019 \n25  Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 10) with leave to amend.                   \n26                             BACKGROUND                                 \n27       Neil Liebick, Jason Franklin, and Sharon Clark, individually and as guardian ad \n28  litem for Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and John Doe, (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) purchased \n1  an electric range that was manufactured by Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and \n2  sold by Costco Wholesale Corp. (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d).  (Notice of Removal at \n3  15, ECF No. 1.)   After Plaintiffs\u2019 house burned down in January 2024, Plaintiffs learned \n4  that their electric range was subject to a voluntary recall because the knobs could be \n5  activated through accidental contact.  (Id. at 16.)  Plaintiff filed a form complaint (\u201cthe \n6  Complaint\u201d), bringing causes of action for strict liability, negligence, and breach of \n7  warranty.  (Id. at 15.)  The only factual allegations that Plaintiffs provided were: \n8       On January 8, 2024 Samsung Model No. NE58K9850WS/AA, while being \n        used in a foreseeable manner as the primary range/stove in the kitchen \n9       of Plaintiffs\u2019 family home, located 15801 Horseless Carriage Drive, \n        Redding, CA 96001, started a fire. The fire destroyed the house and its \n10       contents and resulted in bodily injury to all Plaintiffs other than Neil \n        Liebick, who was away on a business trip. Plaintiff\u2019s [sic] purchased the \n11       product from Costco in or about 2023. After the fire, this model electric \n        range was subject to a voluntary product recall by Samsung because the \n12       front-mounted knobs can be activated through accidental contact by \n        people or pets. That defect caused this fire.                    \n13                                                                        \n   (Id. at 16.)

(Opp\u2019n at 5.)  \n28  Because the Court need not consider this litigation to reach its decision, the request is denied as moot. \n1  legal theory.\u201d  Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. \n2  2008).  While the Court assumes all factual allegations are true and construes \u201cthem \n3  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d  Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. \n4  Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995), the motion must be granted if the \n5  complaint\u2019s allegations do not \u201cplausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief,\u201d Ashcroft \n6  v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).                                   \n7       A complaint need contain only a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim \n8  showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), not \u201cdetailed \n9  factual allegations,\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  However, \n10  this rule demands more than unadorned accusations; \u201csufficient factual matter\u201d must \n11  make the claim at least plausible.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  In the same vein, conclusory \n12  or formulaic recitations of elements alone do not suffice.  Id.  \u201cA claim has facial \n13  plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \n14  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d  Id.   \n15                              DISCUSSION                                \n16  I.   Products Liability                                               \n17       A.   Stating a Claim                                             \n18       A plaintiff may recover for a products liability claim under a theory of strict \n19  liability or negligence.  Trejo v. Johnson & Johnson, 13 Cal. App. 5th 110, 125 (2017).  \n20  To succeed under either theory, a plaintiff must prove: (1) that the product was \n21  defective; and (2) that the defect existed when the product left the hands of the \n22  manufacturer.  Daly v. General Motors Corp., 20 Cal.3d 725, 758 n.1 (1978).  \n23  Additionally, a plaintiff must show \u201ca substantial probability that the design defect, \n24  and not something else, caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d  Stephen v. Ford Motor Co., 134 \n25  Cal. App. 4th 1363, 1373 (2005).                                      \n26       While Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Samsung issued a voluntary recall, they \n27  do not plead that their range in particular had any defect, or that a defect existed \n28  when it left Defendant Samsung.  Even if Plaintiffs satisfied these elements, they fall \n1  far short of plausibly stating that \u201cthe design defect, and not something else, caused\u201d \n2  their injury.  See id.  Plaintiffs summarily allege the defect \u201ccaused\u201d the fire, which is a \n3  legal conclusion that the Court is not bound to accept as true.  See Notice of Removal \n4  at 16; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  Similarly, Plaintiffs plead that the electric range \u201cstarted \n5  a fire,\u201d but they provide no factual allegations supporting this conclusory allegation.  \n6  (See Notice of Removal at 16.)  The Complaint is devoid of any factual allegations \n7  showing that the electric range started the fire, much less that a fire was due to a \n8  defect.  As Defendants point out, the Complaint \u201csays nothing about how the fire \n9  began, whether the range was on, how it may have been activated, or how it was \n10  involved in the fire.\u201d  (See Reply at 3, ECF No. 17.)  Because Plaintiffs fail to \n11  adequately allege causation, this claim must be dismissed.            \n12       B.   Theory of Liability                                         \n13       \u201cUnder California law, there are three ways to hold a manufacturer strictly liable \n14  for injuries caused by its product: (1) if the product is defectively manufactured; (2) if \n15  it is defectively designed; or (3) if it is distributed without sufficient warnings or \n16  instructions about its potential for harm.\u201d  Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co., 140 Cal. App. \n17  4th 1202, 1208 (2006) (citation omitted).  As Defendants point out, Plaintiffs do not \n18  identify under which theory they are proceeding.  (See Mot. at 5.)  Plaintiffs seem to \n19  rely on the voluntary recall to establish that there was a defect, but that allegation \n20  alone does not establish liability under any theory.2                 \n21         First, a manufacturing defect theory requires that a \u201cmanufacturing or \n22  production defect is readily identifiable because a defective product is one that \n23  differs from the manufacturer\u2019s intended result or from other ostensibly identical units \n24  of the same product line.\u201d  Barker v. Lull Eng\u2019g Co., 20 Cal. 3d 413, 429 (1978).  \n25  Regarding the electric range, Plaintiffs do not plead that \u201ca suitable design is in place, \n26                                                                        \n\n27  2 Defendants cite out-of-circuit caselaw to posit that a recall cannot constitute a defect.  (See Mot. at 5\u2013\n   6.)  Because Plaintiffs do not plead a theory of liability even when considering the recall, the Court does \n28  not reach this question.                                              \n1  but that the manufacturing process has in some way deviated from that design.\u201d  See \n2  In re Coordinated Latex Glove Litig., 99 Cal. App. 4th 594, 613 (2002).  As such, they \n3  do not state a theory of manufacturing defect.                        \n4       Second, there are two tests for establishing a design defect.  The first is the \n5  consumer expectations test, which requires a plaintiff to show \u201cthat the product failed \n6  to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when using the product in \n7  an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner.\u201d  Karlsson, 140 Cal. App. 4th at 1208.  \n8  Plaintiffs do not satisfy this test, as they do not plead that the electric range failed to \n9  perform as safely as expected when used in an intended manner.  The second test is \n10  the risk-benefit test, \u201cwhere the trier of fact is asked to balance the risk of danger \n11  inherent in the challenged design versus the feasibility of a safer design, the gravity of \n12  the danger, and the adverse consequences to the product of a safer design.\u201d  Id.  \n13  Plaintiffs also fail to satisfy this test because they do not plead any factual allegations \n14  regarding the electric range\u2019s danger.  Accordingly, they do not present a theory of \n15  design defect.                                                        \n16       Finally, a failure to warn theory requires a showing that \u201ca flawlessly designed \n17  or manufactured product becomes defective\u201d because the manufacturer failed to \n18  warn of the product\u2019s \u201cdangerous propensities.\u201d  Id.  Because Plaintiffs do not plead \n19  that Defendants failed to warn them of any danger, they do not state a theory of \n20  failure to warn.                                                      \n21       Plaintiffs do not present any viable theory of strict liability, and thus this claim \n22  must also be dismissed on this independent basis.  Accordingly, the Court grants \n23  Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the products liability claim.                \n24  II.  Negligence                                                       \n25       To establish a claim for negligence, \u201ca plaintiff must show that defendant had a \n26  duty to use due care, that he breached that duty, and that the breach was the \n27  proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.\u201d  Nally v. Grace Cmty. Church, 47 Cal. \n28  3d 278, 292 (1988) (citation omitted).  To show proximate cause, a plaintiff must \n1  demonstrate \u201cthe injury was one that should reasonably have been anticipated as a \n2  natural and probable consequence and as an immediate, as distinguished from a \n3  remote or improbable, result of the negligence.\u201d  Harrison v. Gamatero, 52 Cal. App. \n4  2d 178, 182 (1942).                                                   \n5       Plaintiffs do not plead that Defendants had a duty use to care or that they \n6  breached the duty.  Moreover, even if Plaintiffs pleaded those elements, they fall far \n7  short of plausibly stating that any breach was the proximate cause of their injury.  As \n8  explained above, Plaintiffs do not plead any factual allegations showing that \n9  Defendants\u2019 conduct caused the fire.  See supra Discussion Part I.  They therefore fail \n10  to plead that their injury was reasonably \u201canticipated as a natural and probable \n11  consequence\u201d of Defendants\u2019 negligence.  See Harrison, 52 Cal. App. 2d at 182.  \n12  Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the negligence claim. \n13  III.  Breach of Warranty                                              \n14         \u201cTo plead an action for breach of express warranty under California law, a \n15  plaintiff must allege: (1) the exact terms of the warranty; (2) reasonable reliance \n16  thereon; and (3) a breach of warranty which proximately caused plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d  \n17  Baltazar v. Apple, Inc., Case No. CV-10-3231-JF, 2011 WL 588209, at *2 (N.D. Cal. \n18  Feb. 10, 2011) (citing Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp., 185 Cal. App. 3d 135, 142 \n19  (Ct. App. 1986)).  The Court has already held that Plaintiffs do not show that \n20  Defendants\u2019 conduct was the proximate cause of their injury.  See supra Discussion \n21  Part II.  Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 Motion as to the breach of warranty \n22  claim.                                                                \n23  IV.  Leave to Amend                                                   \n24       A court granting a motion to dismiss a claim must then decide whether to grant \n25  leave to amend.  Leave to amend should be \u201cfreely given\u201d where there is no \u201cundue \n26  delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, . . . undue prejudice to \n27  the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of [the] \n28  amendment . . . .\u201d  Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Eminence Capital, LLC v. \n1  | Aspeon, Inc., 316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (listing the Foman factors as those to \n2  |  be considered when deciding whether to grant leave to amend).  Dismissal without \n3  || leave to amend is proper only if it is clear that \u201cthe complaint could not be saved by \n4  |  any amendment.\u201d  Intri-Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Group, Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1056 (9th \n5 || Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). \n6          Here, leave to amend is appropriate because Plaintiffs state that they can plead \n7  |  additional facts, and the Court finds that Plaintiffs could save a claim by amendment. \n8  |  (See Opp\u2019n at 9.)  Moreover, the Court notes that this action was filed in state court, \n9  | which has more liberal pleading standards than federal court, to which this action was \n10  |  removed.  Plaintiffs have not had the opportunity to amend their complaint since \n11  |  removal.  Accordingly, the Court grants leave to amend as to all claims. \n12                                    CONCLUSION \n13          For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 Motion to \n14  |  Dismiss (ECF No. 10) with leave to amend.  The hearing scheduled for August 21, \n15  |  2025, at 1:30 p.m. in Courtroom 7 before District Judge Daniel J. Calabretta is \n16  | VACATED. \n17          If Plaintiffs elect to file an Amended Complaint, they must do so within twenty- \n18  |  one (21) days of this Order.  Defendants shall file their responses to the Amended \n19  | Complaint within twenty-one (21) days thereafter. \n20 \n          IT IS SO ORDERED. \n22  |  Dated:    _July 31, 2025               \u201cDarl J  Cob     tto\u2014 \n                                            Hon.

WOOD, United States District Judge:                              \n    Plaintiff Juan Lovelady, proceeding pro se, is currently detained at the Otis Bantum \nCorrectional Center on Rikers Island (\u201cOBCC\u201d).  On December 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the \noriginal complaint in this case, alleging that Defendants violated his constitutional rights during \nhis detention at the OBCC.  (ECF No. 1.)  By Order dated January 29, 2025, the Court granted \nPlaintiff leave to file an amended complaint to state facts describing how correctional staff \nviolated his federal constitutional rights.  (ECF No. 8.)  On March 5, 2025, the Court received \nPlaintiff\u2019s amended complaint.  (ECF No. 9.)  Plaintiff alleges that (1) he slipped and fell in his \ncell after the pipes burst and (2) he now suffers from back and knee pain.  (Id. at 9.)  For the \nreasons set forth below, the Court dismisses the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, \nbut grants Plaintiff 30 days\u2019 leave to replead.                           \n\n                      STANDARD OF REVIEW                                 \n    The Court must dismiss a complaint, or any portion of the complaint, that is frivolous or \nmalicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from \na defendant who is immune from such relief.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), 1915A(b); see Abbas \nv. Dixon, 480 F.3d 636, 639 (2d Cir. 2007).  The Court must also dismiss a complaint when the \nCourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims raised.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).   \n    Although the law mandates dismissal on any of these grounds, the Court is obligated to \n\nconstrue pro se pleadings liberally, Harris v. Mills, 572 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir. 2009), and to \ninterpret them to raise the \u201cstrongest [claims] that they suggest,\u201d Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of \nPrisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474-75 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted) (emphasis in original).  But the \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d courts provide to pro se \nlitigants, id. at 475 (citation omitted), has its limits\u2014to state a claim, pro se pleadings still must \ncomply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires a complaint to make \na short and plain statement showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). \n\n                          DISCUSSION                                     \n    The Court construes Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint as asserting a conditions of \nconfinement claim under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  See Darnell v. \n\nPineiro, 849 F.3d 17, 29, 33 n.9 (2d Cir. 2017).                          \n    To state a conditions of confinement claim, a plaintiff must establish two elements: \n(1) that the challenged conditions are sufficiently serious, and (2) that defendant acted with at \nleast deliberate indifference to those conditions.  Id. at 29.  To satisfy the first element, the \nplaintiff must plead facts that \u201cshow that the conditions, either alone or in combination, pose an \nunreasonable risk of serious damage to his health\u201d or safety.  Id. at 30 (citation omitted).  To \nsatisfy the second element, the plaintiff must allege facts showing that a jail official \u201cacted \nintentionally to impose the alleged condition, or recklessly failed to act with reasonable care to \nmitigate the risk that the condition posed to the pretrial detainee even though the defendant-\nofficial knew, or should have known, that the condition posed an excessive risk to health or \nsafety.\u201d  Id. at 35.                                                      \n    It is well-established in this Circuit that \u201callegations of wet floor conditions that cause a \nprisoner to slip and fall, standing alone, do not satisfy the first prong of a conditions of \n\nconfinement claim.\u201d  Luckey v. Jonas, No. 18-CV-8103, 2019 WL 4194297, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept. 4, 2019) (Torres, J.) (quoting Lopez v. Phipps, No. 18-CV-3605, 2019 WL 2504097, at *8 \n(E.D.N.Y. June 17, 2019) (collecting cases)); see also Strange v. Westchester Cnty. Dep\u2019t of \nCorr., No. 17-CV-9968, 2018 WL 3910829, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 2018) (Rom\u00e1n, J.) \n(\u201cDistrict courts in this Circuit have repeatedly held that, standing alone, a claim that a prisoner \nfell on a slippery floor and injured himself fails to satisfy the first prong of a conditions-of-\nconfinement claim.\u201d).                                                     \n    District courts in this Circuit have also held that a slip and fall claim, standing alone, does \nnot satisfy the second prong of a conditions of confinement claim\u2014that correctional staff \nshowed deliberate indifference to a serious risk of harm.  See, e.g., Fredricks v. City of New York, \n\nNo. 12-CV-3734, 2014 WL 3875181, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (Torres, J.) (\u201cA prisoner\u2019s \nbare complaint about a slippery floor, without more, does not state an arguable claim of \ndeliberate indifference.\u201d); Graham v. Poole, 476 F. Supp. 2d 257, 260 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) \n(\u201cAlthough plaintiff alleges that defendants were aware of the dangerous condition of the shower \nfloor, and failed to rectify it, that amounts to nothing more than negligence.\u201d). \n    Plaintiff does not allege any facts showing that his cell conditions posed an unreasonable \nrisk of serious harm to his health and safety, or that any corrections official was deliberately \nindifferent to a risk of serious harm.  He therefore does not satisfy either element of a condition \nof confinement claim.  Thus, while Plaintiff\u2019s allegations may be sufficient to state a claim of \nnegligence under state law, they do not state a federal claim under Section 1983.  The Court \ntherefore dismisses Plaintiff\u2019s claims under Section 1983 for failure to state a claim on which \nrelief may be granted.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii); 1915A(b)(1).  \n\n\n                  LEAVE TO AMEND IS GRANTED                              \n    Plaintiff proceeds in this matter without the benefit of an attorney.  District courts \ngenerally grant a self-represented plaintiff an opportunity to amend a complaint to cure its \ndefects, unless amendment would be futile.  See Hill v. Curcione, 657 F.3d 116, 123-24 (2d Cir. \n2011); Lucente v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp., 310 F.3d 243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002).  Indeed, the Second \nCircuit has cautioned that district courts \u201cshould not dismiss [a pro se complaint] without \ngranting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any \nindication that a valid claim might be stated.\u201d  Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. \n2000) (quoting Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank, 171 F.3d 794, 795 (2d Cir. 1999)).  Because \nPlaintiff may be able to allege additional facts to state a valid conditions of confinement claim, \nthe Court grants Plaintiff 30 days\u2019 leave to file a second amended complaint. \n\n    If Plaintiff does not file a second amended complaint within the time allowed, the Court \nwill direct the Clerk of Court to enter judgment dismissing this action.  \n\n                          CONCLUSION                                     \n    Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, filed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1), is \ndismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The Court grants Plaintiff 30 days\u2019 leave to file a second amended \ncomplaint.                                                                \n    The Court certifies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) that any appeal from this Order would \nnot be taken in good faith, and therefore in forma pauperis status is denied for the purpose of an \nappeal.  See Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 444-45 (1962).      \n    The Court directs the Clerk of Court to hold this matter open on the docket until a civil \n\njudgment is entered.                                                      \nSO ORDERED.                                                               \nDated:  July 29, 2025                                                    \n      New York, New York                                                 \n\n                                   /s/ Kimba M.

Before the Court is ChexSystems\u2019 motion to dismiss \nthe instant action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Doc. 24.  For the \nreasons set forth below, the motion is GRANTED. \nI.     BACKGROUND \n      A.  Factual Background \n      The Court treats Lopez\u2019s September 18, 2024 Verified Petition, Doc. 1-1 at ECF \n6-8, as the operative complaint in this case, and accepts the factual allegations in the \npetition as true for purposes of the instant motion.  Jn re Parmalat Securities Litigation, \n477 F. Supp. 2d 602, 607 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); see also Underdog Trucking, LLC, Reggie \nAnders v. Verizon Services Corp., No. 09 Civ. 8918 (DLC), 2010 WL 2900048, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2010) (assuming facts taken from plaintiffs petition to be true for the \npurposes of deciding a motion to dismiss). \n\n  As discussed below, all claims against Transunion and Experian were voluntarily dismissed with \nprejudice, on February 5 and July 22, 2025, respectively.  Docs. 22, 34. \n\n      Lopez briefly alleges in his Verified Petition that he has been \u201cthe victim of \nidentity theft, identity fraud, unauthorized charges, and fraud,\u201d and as a result he has \n\u201cfiled several disputes\u201d with each of the defendants.  Doc. 1-1 at ECF 7.  Lopez states \nthat all of the defendants \u201chave alleged that they conducted investigations\u201d into each of \nthe disputes he filed, but he asserts that the defendants \u201care lying,\u201d because \u201ca proper and \nthorough investigation into each and every disputed item would take months if not \nseveral years.\u201d  Id. \n      Lopez encloses a supplemental addendum to his Verified Petition, alleging that he \nsuffered \u201cdamage\u201d from ChexSystem\u2019s \u201cnegligence and inaccurate reporting.\u201d  Jd. at \nECF 9.  Furthermore, Lopez alleges that he was denied membership with a credit union. \u201d \nTd. \n      In his opposition to ChexSystem\u2019s motion to dismiss, Lopez bolsters his petition \nby making additional assertions and including exhibits that were not included in his \nVerified Petition or supplemental addendum.  Included as attachments to his opposition \nare three complaints Lopez filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \n(\u201cCFPB\u201d).  Two of those complaints were against ChexSystems and were filed on April \n24, and June 4, 2024.  See generally Docs. 30-7, 30-8.  The third complaint, filed on June \n14, 2024, was against Capital One.  Docs. 30-4, 30-5.  These documents clarify that the \ndisputed information in his consumer report allegedly consists of an \u201cunauthorized and/or \nincorrect charge of nearly $2000\u201d billed to his Capital One account in October of 2019 by \nacar rental company.  Doc. 30-5 at 1.  Lopez alleges that he filed the required disputes \nwith the car rental company and Capital One, but that Capital One was unable to \ndetermine if he was indeed overcharged due to the non-cooperation of the rental car \ncompany.  Doc. 30 at 1.  Lopez claims that he was \u201covercharged,\u201d that the charge was put \non his checking account, and that his checking account was closed as a result.  /d.  The \n\n? Lopez does not explain or otherwise elaborate in his Verified Petition on what basis he was denied \nmembership.\n\nclosing of his checking account, he alleges, was reported to ChexSystems, and later \nappeared on his consumer report when he applied for membership at the Andrews Credit \nUnion, which was denied.  /d. \n     Lopez received responses to both CFPB complaints he filed against ChexSystems. \nIn those responses, ChexSystems indicated that it reached out to Capital One which \nverified the information as accurate and complete.  Doc. 30-7 at 3-4; Doc. 30-8 at 2-3. \nHe also received a response to his Capital One complaint which confirmed the \u201cdispute \nwas handled correctly,\u201d and that \u201cthe account [reported] accurately to ChexSystems[.]\u201d \nDoc. 30-1 at 1. \n     In his opposition, Lopez further clarifies that he seeks to have ChexSystems \n\u201cremove the inaccurate information or perform [a] proper investigation to determine the \nvalidity of the alleged debt[.]\u201d  Doc. 30 at 2.  He also raises several questions regarding \nChexSystems\u2019 investigation, namely:  (1) how it communicated with Capital One; (2) \nwhat was said; (3) who it spoke with at Capital One; (4) what evidence Capital One \nprovided to confirm the information was accurate and complete; and (5) because \u201cthe \ncontroversy . . . originated from the car rental company,\u201d whether ChexSystems \ncontacted the car rental company to ascertain if the alleged debt was accurate.  /d. \n     B.  Procedural History \n     Lopez filed the instant action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, \nCounty of Dutchess, on September 18, 2024.*  Doc. 1-1.  Lopez cites to 15 U.S.C. \n1681e(b) and 1681i\u2014two statutes within the FCRA\u2014 in  his supplemental addendum. * \n\n3 On May 8, 2024, prior to filing the instant action, Lopez filed another action in this District making the \nsame or similar claims against the three defendants in this action.  See Lopez v. Equifax, Inc., 24 Civ. 03681 \n(LTS), Doc. 1 (S.D.N-Y.).  In that matter, Lopez moved to voluntarily dismiss his claims against defendants \nChexSystems, Experian, and Transunion on November 15, 2024. Id. at Doc. 9.  The Court granted that \ndismissal on November 21, 2024. Id. at Doc. 10. \n+ Section 1681e(b) provides, inter alia:  \u201cWhenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer \nreport it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information \nconcerning the individual about whom the report relates.\u201d  Section 16811 provides, inter alia:  \u201cif the \ncompleteness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer\u2019s file at a consumer reporting \nagency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through\n\nId. at ECF 9-10.  On October 18, 2024, Transunion, with the consent of Experian and \nChexSystems, removed the action to this District based on federal question jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) and \u00a7 1441(a).  Doc. 1; Doc 1-2; Doc 1-3. \n      On February 3, 2025, Lopez and Transunion filed a stipulation of dismissal, with \nprejudice, of all claims against Transunion, Doc. 20, which the Court so-ordered on \nFebruary 5, 2025, Doc. 22.  On June 16, 2025, Experian notified the Court that it had \nreached a settlement with Lopez in principle as to all claims.  Doc. 32.  And on July 22, \n2025, Lopez and Experian filed a stipulation of dismissal, with prejudice, of all claims \nagainst Experian, Doc. 34, which the Court so-ordered on July 23, 2025, Doc. 35. \n      On March 24, 2025, ChexSystems filed the instant motion to dismiss Lopez\u2019s \npetition for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that Lopez offers \nonly \u201cnaked and conclusory assertion[s] that ChexSystems harmed him.\u201d  Doc. 24; Doc. \n26 at 1,5.  On April 16, 2025, Lopez filed his opposition to ChexSystems\u2019 motion to \ndismiss.  Docs. 29, 30. \nII.    LEGAL STANDARD \n      In considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court accepts all \nfactual allegations in the complaint as true and draws all reasonable inferences in the \nplaintiff's favor.  See, e.g., Koch v. Christie's International PLC, 699 F.3d 141, 145 (2d \nCir. 2012). \n      \u201c(T]he pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require \u2018detailed factual \nallegations,\u2019 but it demands more than an unadorned, the defendant-unlawfully-harmed- \nme accusation.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Igbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. \nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)).  \u201c[T]he tenet that a court must accept a \n\na reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to \ndetermine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed \ninformation, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph (5), before the end of the 30-day \nperiod beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from \nthe consumer or reseller.\u201d\n\ncomplaint\u2019s allegations as true is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action's \nelements, supported by mere conclusory statements.\u201d  \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 at 663 (citing Twombly, 550 \nU.S. at 555).  \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss,  a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d  Jd. at 678 \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  This \u201cplausibility standard is not akin to a \n\u2018probability requirement,\u2019 but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has \nacted unlawfully.\u201d  Jd. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  To state a plausible claim, \nthe plaintiff must \u201c\u2018raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\u2019 of \nthe wrongdoing alleged, \u2018even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is \nimprobable.\u2019\u201d  Citizens United v. Schneiderman, 882 F.3d 374, 380 (2d. Cir. 2018) \n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  Ifthe plaintiff has not \u201cnudged [his] claims across \nthe line from conceivable to plausible, [his] complaint must be dismissed.\u201d  Twombly, \n550 USS. at 570. \n    Pro se litigants\u2019 \u201cpleadings and other filings are interpreted to raise the strongest \nclaims they suggest.\u201d  See Sharikov v. Philips Medical System MR, Inc., 103 F.4th 159, \n166 (2d Cir. 2024) (citing McLeod v. Jewish Guild for the Blind, 864 F.3d 154, 156-58 \n(2d Cir. 2017)).  In general, a court should not dismiss a pro se complaint without \n\u201cgranting leave to amend at least once when a  liberal reading of the complaint gives any \nindication that a valid claim might be stated.\u201d  See Chavis v. Chappius, 618 F.3d 162, 170 \n(2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Branum v. Clark, 927 F.2d 698, 705 (2d Cir. 1991)). \nIl.    DISCUSSION \n     A.  Failure to State a Claim \n     The Court finds that Lopez fails to state a claim pursuant to either \u00a7 16811 or \u00a7 \n1681e(b).  The FCRA requires that a consumer reporting agency (\u201cCRA\u201d) \u201cfollow \nreasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information \nconcerning the individual about whom the report relates.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a71681le(b).  To state \na claim that  a CRA did not follow reasonable procedures, a plaintiff must show that:  (1)\n\nthe CRA was negligent or willful in that it failed to follow reasonable procedures to \nassure the accuracy of its credit report; (2) the CRAreported inaccurate information \nabout the plaintiff; (3) the plaintiff was injured; and (4) the CRA\u2019s negligence \nproximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury.  Gestetner v. Equifax Information Services LLC, \nNo. 18 Civ. 5665 (JFK), 2019 WL 1172283, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2019) (quoting \nAdams v. National Engineering Service Corp., 620 F. Supp. 2d 319, 330 (D. Conn. \n2009)).  Additionally, \u00a7 1681i provides that a CRA \u201cmust conduct a \u2018reasonable \nreinvestigation\u2019 if a consumer disputes an item on her credit report.\u201d  Jones v. Experian \nInformation Solutions, Inc., 982 F. Supp. 2d 268, 272 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1681i(a)(1)(A)).                                               \n    Both statutes require a plaintiff to show that a consumer report is inaccurate.  See \nJones, 982 F. Supp. 2d at 272\u201373 (A \u201cplaintiff asserting claims under \u00a7 1681i must \ndemonstrate that the disputed information is inaccurate in order to prevail on allegations \nthat a consumer reporting agency had failed to reasonably reinvestigate a disputed \nitem.\u201d); Sessa v. Trans Union, LLC, 74 F.4th 38, 42 (2d Cir. 2023) (\u201cTo prevail in [a\u00a7 \n1681e(b)] action, the consumer must establish that the challenged report is inaccurate.\u201d) \n(citing Shimon v. Equifax Information Services LLC, 994 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 2021)).  \nFurthermore, to adequately state a claim, the burden is on the plaintiff to \u201cidentify the \nspecific information on his credit report that is inaccurate and explain why the identified \ninformation is inaccurate.\u201d  Phipps v. Experian, No. 20 Civ. 3368 (LLS), 2020 WL \n3268488, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 15, 2020).                                \n    In his Verified Petition, Lopez asserts that \u201che has been the victim of identity \ntheft, identity fraud, unauthorized charges and fraud,\u201d and that he wishes \u201cto have a \nnumber of incorrect, improper and fraudulent items removed from his credit report[.]\u201d  \nDoc 1-1 at 6\u20137.  Critically, however, he has not alleged what information on his \nconsumer report is inaccurate or how it is inaccurate.  Furthermore, he has not shown \nhow ChexSystems violated the FCRA or when it reported the information.  Nor does he \nmention ChexSystems by name in the Verified Petition\u2014seemingly referencing it only \nwhen referring to all Defendants jointly as \u201crespondents.\u201d  This is insufficient to \nadequately plead a claim pursuant to the FCRA.  See Manzano v. Trans Union (of \nDelaware) LLC, No. 23 Civ. 5990 (JGLC) (JLC), 2024 WL 3194091, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nJune 27, 2024) (dismissing FCRA claim where plaintiff failed \u201cto specify what and how \nthe information was inaccurate,\u201d and only asserted allegations that were \u201centirely \nconclusory and insufficient to state a claim\u201d); Viverette v. Experian, No. 21 Civ. 6989 \n(LTS), 2022 WL 357274, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2022) (finding that plaintiff failed to \nstate a claim under either \u00a7 1681e or \u00a7 1681i by failing to specify \u201cnames, addresses, \naccounts, or other information that is inaccurate,\u201d and \u201cnot stat[ing] facts explaining why \nsuch information is inaccurate.\u201d).                                      \n    Even if the Court considers the additional facts and materials in Lopez\u2019s \nopposition to ChexSystems\u2019 motion, he still fails to show how the consumer report is \ninaccurate.  \u201c[I]n deciding a motion to dismiss a pro se complaint, it is appropriate to \nconsider materials outside the complaint to the extent that they are consistent with the \nallegations in the complaint[.]\u201d  Rivera v. Royce, No. 19 Civ. 10425 (PMH), 2021 WL \n2413396, at *5 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 2021) (quoting Davis v. County of Suffolk, No. 18 \nCiv. 303 (JMA) (AKT), 2020 WL 7699919, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2020)).  And \nalthough not incorporated in his original petition, this Court may consider extrinsic \ndocuments if they are:  (1) attached to the complaint; (2) incorporated into the complaint \nby reference; or (3) integral to the complaint.  DeLuca v. AccessIT Group, Inc., 695 F. \nSupp. 2d 54, 60 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).  To the extent that those materials are incorporated into \nthe complaint by reference or integral to the complaint, Lopez\u2019s claims still do not pass \nmuster.                                                                 \n    The Second Circuit has firmly held that \u201cinaccuracies that turn on legal disputes \nare not cognizable under the FCRA.\u201d  Mader v. Experian Information Solutions, Inc., 56 \nF.4th 264, 270 (2d Cir. 2023).  Lopez\u2019s claim turns on the validity of a $2000 charge \nmade to his Capital One account.  Doc. 30-5 at 1.  Lopez claims the charge was \n\u201cunauthorized\u201d and \u201cincorrect.\u201d  Id. That Lopez believes it is incorrect does not make the \ninformation on the consumer report inaccurate.  \u201c[I]naccurate information reported on a \nconsumer\u2019s credit report must be objectively and readily verifiable[.]\u201d  Sessa, 74 F.4th at \n43.  Lopez fails to state why the charge was unauthorized and incorrect, or why the \ninformation on the report was inaccurate.  Instead, he merely asserts that he seeks to \n\u201cremove the inaccurate information or perform the proper investigation to determine the \nvalidity of the alleged debt.\u201d  Doc. 30 at 2.                           \n    This is insufficient to make a claim pursuant to the FCRA. See Mader, 56 F.4th \nat 270 (holding that determining the validity of a debt \u201cis not sufficiently objectively \nverifiable to render [plaintiff\u2019s] credit report \u2018inaccurate\u2019 under the FCRA.\u201d); Fashakin v. \nNextel Communications, No. 05 Civ. 3080 (RRM), 2009 WL 790350, at *11 (E.D.N.Y. \nMar. 25, 2009) (dismissing an FCRA claim because the plaintiff \u201cfailed to demonstrate \nthat [the CRA\u2019s] reporting of her debt [to a third party] was inaccurate,\u201d even if the \nplaintiff disputed that debt); Taylor v. Experian Information Solutions, Inc., No. 24 Civ. \n188 (DNH) (MJK), 2024 WL 618741, at *5 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2024) (holding that a \nplaintiff\u2019s claim pursuant to the FCRA that challenges \u201cthe validity of a debt assessed by \na third-party,\u201d fails \u201cbecause \u2018inaccuracies that turn on legal disputes are not cognizable \nunder the FRCA.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Mader, 56 F.4th at 270); Holland v. Chase Bank USA, \nNorth America, 475 F. Supp. 3d 272, 276 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (dismissing FCRA claim \nbecause \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s legal challenge to the validity of a debt is alone insufficient to make \na report of that debt factually inaccurate.\u201d).                          \n    The Court also finds that Lopez fails to adequately allege that ChexSystems failed \nto \u201cfollow reasonable procedures\u201d or \u201cconduct a reasonable investigation.\u201d  \u00a71681e(b); \n\u00a71681i.  Lopez asserts that \u201cRespondents\u201d did not \u201cengage in a proper and thorough \ninvestigation into each and every disputed item,\u201d because it \u201cwould take months if not \nseveral years\u201d to do so.  Doc 1-1 at 7.  As ChexSystems points out, nowhere in his \npetition does Lopez support the claim that such an investigation should have required \nmonths or years.  Doc. 26 at 8.  Nothing in the Verified Petition specifically alleges what \nChexSystems did or did not do.  Similarly, the supplemental addendum simply alleges \nthat Lopez incurred \u201cdamage\u201d as a result of ChexSystems\u2019 \u201cnegligence and inaccurate \nreporting,\u201d but there is no mention of how ChexSystems was negligent or inaccurate in \nits reporting.  Doc. 1-1 at ECF 9.  Again, these conclusory allegations are not sufficient to \nstate a claim pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1681e(b) and 1681i.  See Ahmad v. Experian Information \nSolutions, Inc., No. 23 Civ. 2222 (LJL), 2023 WL 8650192, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, \n2023) (\u201cAbsent any allegations as to what Defendant did or did not do in the course of \nreinvestigating, Plaintiff fails to state a negligent, much less willful, violation of \u00a7 1681i.\u201d \n(emphasis in original)); Viverette, 2022 WL 357274, at *3 (holding that plaintiff failed to \nstate a claim under either statute because they did \u201cnot allege any facts showing that \n[defendant] failed to follow reasonable reinvestigation procedures.\u201d).  \n    And again, even considering the additional allegations made in his opposition, \nLopez fails to show how ChexSystems\u2019 failed to follow reasonable procedures or that its \ninvestigation was unreasonable.  Lopez offers various hypothetical questions concerning \nthe method and form of ChexSystems\u2019 communications with Capital One, but does not \nsupport those hypotheticals with any factual allegations of wrongdoing by ChexSystems.  \nDoc. 30 at 2.  He acknowledges that the controversy arises from a dispute with the car \nrental company, and questions whether ChexSystems contacted the car rental company to \ndetermine whether the debt was accurate.  Id.  Again, \u201cinaccurate information reported on \na consumer\u2019s credit report must be objectively and readily verifiable[.]\u201d  Sessa, 74 F.4th \nat 43; Hosssain v. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, 693 F. Supp. 3d 358, 363 \n(E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2023) (\u201cCRAs are not required to adjudicate intricate issues . . . to \nensure the accuracy of a consumer\u2019s credit report.  Instead, CRAs must focus on \nstraightforward, objectively and readily verifiable information when conducting its \ninvestigations under the FCRA[.]\u201d).  Ultimately, Lopez makes the claim that \nChexSystems disseminated false, misleading, and inaccurate information.  Doc. 30 at 2.  \nWith no factual basis to support his claims, the allegations are plainly conclusory.   \n    ChexSystems also claims that Lopez failed to satisfy his statutory requirement of \n\u201cnotif[ying] the agency directly\u201d by submitting his complaints against ChexSystems \nthrough the CFPB, rather than with ChexSystems directly.  Doc. 31 at 5; \u00a7 1681i(a)(1)(A) \n(emphasis added).  In light of the Court\u2019s finding that Lopez failed to state a claim \npursuant to the FCRA, the Court need not determine whether Lopez satisfied the statutory \nrequirement.  Accordingly, ChexSystems\u2019 motion to dismiss the instant action is granted. \n    B.  Leave to Amend                                                 \n    Although Lopez does not ask the Court for leave to amend, ChexSytems argues \nthat he should not be granted leave because any amendment would be futile.  Doc. 26 at \n9; Doc. 31 at 7.  It being within the Court\u2019s discretion, the Court grants Lopez leave to \namend.  \u201c[A] pro se litigant in particular should be afforded every reasonable opportunity \nto demonstrate that he has a valid claim.\u201d  Nielsen v. Rabin, 746 F.3d 58, 62 (2d Cir. \n2014) (quoting Matima v. Celli, 228 F.3d 68, 81 (2d Cir. 2000)).  Accordingly, \u201cdistrict \ncourts generally should grant a self-represented plaintiff an opportunity to amend a \ncomplaint to cure its defects, unless amendment would be futile.\u201d  Ahmad, 2023 WL \n8650192, at * 9 (citing Shomo v. City of New York, 579 F.3d 176, 183 (2d Cir. 2009)); see \nalso Gomez v. USAA Federal Savings Bank, 171 F.3d 794, 795 (2d Cir. 1999) (\u201c[A] pro \nse complaint is to be read liberally,\u201d and \u201cthe court should not dismiss without granting \nleave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication \nthat a valid claim might be stated.\u201d).                                  \n    In the instant case, Lopez provides new details about the controversy in his \nopposition to ChexSystems\u2019 motion.  Doc. 30.  For example, he discusses the allegedly \nunauthorized $2000 charge by the car rental company and attaches his complaints with \nCapital One and ChexSystems.  See generally Docs. 30-5, 30-7, 30-8.  Lopez\u2019s expansion \nand clarification of the record demonstrates that he may be able to provide a more \ncomplete account of his allegations if given the opportunity to file an amended complaint. \nFurthermore, Lopez\u2019s pleadings contain certain informational gaps, which if clarified, \ncould help cure the defects in his claims.  For example, Lopez could hypothetically detail \nwhat ChexSystems reported, how the report was allegedly inaccurate, and how \nChexSystems exactly failed to conduct a reasonable investigation. \n     Because Lopez\u2019s amended complaint will completely replace, not supplement, the \noriginal complaint, any facts or claims that he wants to include from the original \ncomplaint must be repeated in the amended complaint. \nIV.    CONCLUSION \n     For the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED without prejudice \nwith leave to amend the complaint.  Lopez must file his Amended Complaint, if at all, by \nSeptember 2, 2025.  If he fails to do so, the case will be closed.  The Clerk of the Court is \nrespectfully directed to terminate the motion, Doc. 24, as well as Lopez\u2019s opposition, \nDoc. 29. \n\nIt is SO ORDERED. \n\nPaes   Aas   12005                         PAY \n                                      ~   EDGARDO RAMOS, U.S.D.J. \n\n                                  1]"

Currently  pending  before  the  Court  is \n12   Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. (ECF No. 24.) On May 5, 2025, the Court \n13   gave Scott notice of Defendants\u2019 motion pursuant to the requirements of Klingele v. \n14   Eikenberry, 849 F.2d 409 (9th Cir. 1988), and Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. \n15   1998). (ECF No. 25.) Scott did not timely file his response, thus the Court sua sponte \n16   granted Scott an extension of time to file his response. (ECF No. 26.) To date, Scott has \n17   failed  to file  an opposition  to  the motion. For  the  reasons  stated  below,  the  Court \n18   recommends Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, (ECF No. 24), be granted. \n19   I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY                       \n20        Scott is formerly an inmate incarcerated in the Nevada Department of Corrections \n21   (\u201cNDOC\u201d) and housed at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center (\u201cNNCC\u201d). On June 8, \n22   2023, Scott submitted a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging he was \n23   retaliated against for seeking medical treatment. (ECF No. 1-1.) In this complaint, Scott \n24   alleges that he has a kidney condition for which he receives dialysis treatment. (Id. at 4.) \n25   Nephrologist Dr. Quigley ordered that all dialysis patients, including Scott, receive a bag \n26   of ice daily as part of their treatment. (Id.) Dr. Quigley\u2019s order for medical ice was not set \n\n27   1    This Report and Recommendation is made to the Honorable Miranda M. Du, \n    United States District Judge. The action was referred to the undersigned Magistrate \n1   to expire until November 2023. (Id.) But prison medical staff discontinued Dr. Quigley\u2019s \n2   order before then. (Id.)                                             \n3        On November 17, 2022, Scott alleges he met with Dr. Quigley and prison nurse \n4   Melissa Michell for his monthly medical consultation regarding his medical condition and \n5   dialysis treatment. (Id.) Scott asked Dr. Quigley to reinstate his order for medical ice. (Id. \n6   at 5.) Scott asked Dr. Quigley to make the order just for him based on his own medical \n7   needs even Scott knew that Dr. Quigley preferred to issue orders that applied to all \n8   dialysis patients, not for each patient individually. (Id.)          \n9        Scott alleges that on the same day, Michell wrote Scott up on a \u201ctrumped up charge \n10   of Compromising Staff (a Class A offense).\u201d (Id.) Scott alleges this resulted in him being \n11   housed in segregation \u201cfor an extended period of time and having his [liberties] placed in \n12   jeopardy unduly.\u201d (Id. at 6.) On December 3, 2022, a preliminary hearing was held where \n13   Scott pled not guilty to the charge and provided a statement. (ECF No. 24-2 at 3.) On \n14   January 31, 2023, Scott was found not guilty of the charge. (Id. at 5.)  \n15        On  December  9, 2022,  Scott  initiated informal  grievance  No.  2006-31-46153 \n16   alleging he was retaliated against for \u201cengag[ing] in activity protected by the Eighth \n17   Amendment access to proper and adequate medical treatment.\u201d (ECF No. 24-3 at 50.) \n18   On January 3, 2023, Scott\u2019s informal grievance was denied for including more than one \n    issue on his grievance. (Id.) On March 7, 2023, Scott resubmitted his informal grievance. \n19                                                                        \n    (Id.) On April 3, 2023, the informal grievance was denied for \u201cno harm/loss, action or \n20                                                                        \n    remedy.\u201d (Id.) On May 9, 2023, Scott again resubmitted his informal grievance. (Id.) On \n21                                                                        \n    May 30, 2023, Scott\u2019s informal grievance was again denied for \u201cno harm/loss, action or \n22                                                                        \n    remedy.\u201d (Id.) Scott never raised the grievance beyond the informal level. (Id.) \n23                                                                        \n         On June 12, 2023, Scott filed suit alleging a First Amendment retaliation claim \n24                                                                        \n    against Michell, which was allowed proceed following the screening of Scott\u2019s complaint. \n25                                                                        \n    (ECF Nos. 1-1; 6.)                                                   \n26                                                                        \n         On May 2, 2025, Defendants filed the instant motion arguing summary judgment \n27                                                                        \n    should be granted in their favor because: (1) Scott failed to exhaust his administrative \n1   remedies; and (2) Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. (ECF No. 24.) Scott\u2019s \n2   opposition was due on May 23, 2025, which he did not file. On May 28, 2025, the Court \n3   sua sponte extended Scott\u2019s deadline to oppose Defendants\u2019 motion. (ECF No. 26.) To \n4   date, however, Scott has not filed an opposition or otherwise responded to Defendants\u2019 \n5   motion.                                                              \n6   II.  LEGAL STANDARDS                                                 \n7        \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no \n8   genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \n9   of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The \n10   substantive law applicable to the claim determines which facts are material. Coles v. \n11   Eagle, 704 F.3d 624, 628 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, \n12   248 (1986)). Only disputes over facts that address the main legal question of the suit can \n13   preclude summary judgment, and factual disputes that are irrelevant are not material. \n14   Frlekin v. Apple, Inc., 979 F.3d 639, 644 (9th Cir. 2020). A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only where \n15   a reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248. \n16        The parties subject to a motion for summary judgment must: (1) cite facts from the \n17   record, including but not limited to depositions, documents, and declarations, and then \n18   (2) \u201cshow[] that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine \n19   dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\u201d \n20   Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c)(1).  Documents  submitted  during  summary  judgment  must  be \n21   authenticated, and if only personal knowledge authenticates a document (i.e., even a \n22   review of the contents of the document would not prove that it is authentic), an affidavit \n23   attesting to its authenticity must be attached to the submitted document. Las Vegas \n24   Sands, LLC v. Neheme, 632 F.3d 526, 532-33 (9th Cir. 2011). Conclusory statements, \n25   speculative opinions, pleading allegations, or other assertions uncorroborated by facts \n26   are insufficient to establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute. Soremekun v. \n27   Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007).            \n1   genuine dispute. See id. \u201cWhere the moving party will have the burden of proof on an \n2   issue at trial, the movant must affirmatively demonstrate that no reasonable trier of fact \n3   could find other than for the moving party.\u201d Id. However, if the moving party does not bear \n4   the  burden  of  proof  at  trial,  the  moving  party  may  meet  their  initial  burden  by \n5   demonstrating either: (1) there is an absence of evidence to support an essential element \n6   of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim or claims; or (2) submitting admissible evidence that \n7   establishes the record forecloses the possibility of a reasonable jury finding in favor of the \n8   nonmoving party. See Pakootas v. Teck Cominco Metals, Ltd., 905 F.3d 565, 593-94 (9th \n9   Cir. 2018); Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. \n10   2000). The court views all evidence and any inferences arising therefrom in the light most \n11   favorable to the nonmoving party. Colwell v. Bannister, 763 F.3d 1060, 1065 (9th Cir. \n12   2014). If the moving party does not meet its burden for summary judgment, the nonmoving \n13   party is not required to provide evidentiary materials to oppose the motion, and the court \n14   will deny summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.             \n15        Where the moving party has met its burden, however, the burden shifts to the \n16   nonmoving  party  to  establish  that  a  genuine  issue  of  material  fact  actually  exists. \n17   Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586, (1986). The \n18   nonmoving must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings\u201d to meet this burden. Pac. Gulf Shipping Co. \n19   v. Vigorous Shipping & Trading S.A., 992 F.3d 893, 897 (9th Cir. 2021) (internal quotation \n20   omitted). In other words, the nonmoving party may not simply rely upon the allegations or \n21   denials of its pleadings; rather, they must tender evidence of specific facts in the form of \n22   affidavits, and/or admissible discovery material in support of its contention that such a \n23   dispute exists. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 n. 11. This burden \n24   is \u201cnot a light one,\u201d and requires the nonmoving party to \u201cshow more than the mere \n25   existence of a scintilla of evidence.\u201d Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586 n. 11 (quoting In re \n26   Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d 376, 387 (9th Cir. 2010)). The non-moving party \u201cmust \n27   come forth with evidence from which a jury could reasonably render a verdict in the non-\n1   Litig., 627 F.3d at 387). Mere assertions and \u201cmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts\u201d \n2   will  not  defeat  a  properly  supported  and  meritorious  summary  judgment  motion. \n3   Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586-87.                                      \n4        When a pro se litigant opposes summary judgment, his or her contentions in \n5   motions and pleadings may be considered as evidence to meet the non-party\u2019s burden to \n6   the extent: (1) contents of the document are based on personal knowledge, (2) they set \n7   forth facts that would be admissible into evidence, and (3) the litigant attested under \n8   penalty of perjury that they were true and correct. Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 923 \n9   (9th Cir. 2004).                                                     \n10        Upon the parties meeting their respective burdens for the motion for summary \n11   judgment, the court determines whether reasonable minds could differ when interpreting \n12   the record; the court does not weigh the evidence or determine its truth. Velazquez v. City \n13   of Long Beach, 793 F.3d 1010, 1018 (9th Cir. 2015). The court may consider evidence in \n14   the record not cited by the parties, but it is not required to do so. See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n15   56(c)(3). Nevertheless, the Court will view the cited records before it and will not mine the \n16   record for triable issues of fact. Oracle Corp. Sec. Litig., 627 F.3d at 386 (holding that if a \n17   nonmoving party does not make nor provide support for a possible objection, the court \n18   will likewise not consider it).                                      \n19   III.  DISCUSSION                                                     \n20        Defendants argue summary judgment should be entered because Scott failed to \n21   exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing this lawsuit. (ECF No. 24.) Under the \n22   Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), \u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison \n23   conditions under [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in \n24   any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are \n25   available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Exhaustion is mandatory. See Porter v. \n26   Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002). The requirement\u2019s underlying premise is to \u201creduce \n27   the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits\u201d by affording prison officials the \u201ctime \n1   case. In some instances, corrective action taken in response to an inmate\u2019s grievance \n2   might improve prison administration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obviating the need \n3   for litigation.\u201d Id. at 524-25.                                      \n4        The PLRA requires \u201cproper exhaustion\u201d of an inmate\u2019s claims. Woodford v. Ngo, \n5   548 U.S. 81, 90 (2006). Proper exhaustion means an inmate must \u201cuse all steps the prison \n6   holds out, enabling the prison to reach the merits of the issue.\u201d Griffin v. Arpaio, 557 F.3d \n7   1117, 1119 (9th Cir. 2009) (citing Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90). Thus, exhaustion \u201cdemands \n8   compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical procedural rules because no \n9   adjudication system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on \n10   the course of its proceedings.\u201d Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90-91.         \n11        In the Ninth Circuit, a motion for summary judgment will typically be the appropriate \n12   vehicle to determine whether an inmate has properly exhausted his or her administrative \n13   remedies. Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1169 (9th Cir. 2014). \u201cIf undisputed evidence \n14   viewed in the light most favorable to the prisoner shows a failure to exhaust, a defendant \n15   is entitled to summary judgment under Rule 56. If material facts are disputed, summary \n16   judgment should be denied, and the district judge rather than a jury should determine the \n17   facts.\u201d Id. at 1166. The question of exhaustion \u201cshould be decided, if feasible, before \n18   reaching the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d Id. at 1170.             \n19        Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 216 \n20   (2007). The defendant bears the burden of proving that an available administrative \n21   remedy was unexhausted by the inmate. Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172. If the defendant makes \n22   such a showing, the burden shifts to the inmate to \u201cshow there is something in his case \n23   that  made  the  existing  and  generally  available  administrative  remedies  effectively \n24   unavailable to him by \u2018showing that the local remedies were ineffective, unobtainable, \n25   unduly prolonged, inadequate, or obviously futile.\u2019\u201d Williams v. Paramo, 775 F.3d 1182, \n26   1191 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172).             \n27   ///                                                                  \n1        A.   NDOC\u2019s Inmate Grievance System                             \n2        Administrative Regulation (\u201cAR\u201d) 740 governs the grievance process at NDOC \n3   institutions. (See ECF No. 24-6.) An inmate must grieve through all three levels: (1) \n4   Informal; (2) First Level; and (3) Second Level. (Id. at 11-16.) The inmate may file an \n5   informal grievance within six months \u201cif the issue involves personal property damages or \n6   loss, personal injury, medical claims or any other tort claims, including civil rights claims.\u201d \n7   (Id. at 11.) The inmate\u2019s failure to submit the informal grievance within this period \u201cshall \n8   constitute abandonment of the inmate\u2019s grievance at this, and all subsequent levels.\u201d (Id. \n9   at 12.) NDOC staff is required to respond within forty-five days. (Id. at 13.)  \n10        Per AR 740, a grievance at any level may be either, \u201cgranted, denied, partially \n11   granted, abandoned, duplicate, not accepted or grievable, resolved, settled, withdrawn; \n12   or referred to the Office of the Inspector General.\u201d (Id. at 3.) If a grievance is \u201cgranted\u201d or \n13   resolved by \u201csettlement\u201d at any level, the grievance process is considered complete. (Id. \n14   at 6.) However, if a grievance is either \u201cpartially granted, denied, or resolved\u201d at any level, \n15   the inmate must appeal the response to the next level for the grievance process to be \n16   deemed \u201ccomplete\u201d for purposes of exhausting their administrative remedies. (Id.)  \n17        The appeal of an informal grievance is called a \u201cFirst Level Grievance\u201d and must \n18   be filed within 5 days of receiving a response. (Id. at 13.) A First Level Grievance should \n19   be reviewed, investigated, and responded to by the Warden at the institution where the \n20   incident  being  grieved  occurred;  however,  the  Warden  may  utilize  any  staff  in  the \n21   development of a grievance response. (Id.) The time limit for a response to the inmate is \n22   forty-five days. (Id. at 14.)                                        \n23        Within five days of receiving a First Level response, the inmate may appeal to the \n24   Second Level Grievance, which is subject to still-higher review. (Id. at 15.) Officials are to \n25   respond to a Second Level Grievance within sixty days, specifying the decision and the \n26   reasons the decision was reached. (Id.at 15.) Upon receiving a response to the Second \n27   Level  Grievance,  the  inmate  will  be  deemed  to  have  exhausted  his  administrative \n1        B.   Analysis                                                   \n2        In this case, Defendants argue Scott failed to properly exhaust his administrative \n3   remedies because he did not fully appeal his grievances through all the necessary \n4   grievance  levels.  (ECF  No.  24  at  5-11.)  To  support  their  arguments,  Defendants \n5   submitted copies of Scott\u2019s inmate grievance history, including the grievance that relates \n6   to the claim at issue in this case\u2014Grievance No. 2006-31-46153. (See ECF No. 24-3 \n7   (Scott\u2019s Inmate Grievance History).)                                 \n8        A careful review of these records supports Defendants\u2019 arguments. Although Scott \n9   filed an informal grievance related to alleged incidents of his claim in this case, the \n10   grievance was not properly grieved through all three levels as required by AR 740. On \n11   December 9, 2022, Scott initiated Informal Grievance No. 2006-31-46153 asserting he \n    was retaliated against by Michell. (See ECF No. 24-3 at 50.) On January 3, 2023, Scott\u2019s \n12                                                                        \n    informal grievance was denied for including more than one issue on his grievance. (Id.) \n13                                                                        \n    On March 7, 2023, Scott resubmitted his informal grievance. (Id.) On April 3, 2023, the \n14                                                                        \n    informal grievance was again denied for \u201cno harm/loss, action or remedy.\u201d (Id.)

No other grievances regarding \n18                                                                        \n    the retaliation claim here was filed.                                \n19                                                                        \n         It is well established that the PLRA requires \u201cproper exhaustion\u201d of an inmate\u2019s \n20                                                                        \n    claims. See Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90. Proper exhaustion means an inmate must \u201cuse all \n21                                                                        \n    steps the prison holds out, enabling the prison to reach the merits of the issue.\u201d Griffin, \n22                                                                        \n    557 F.3d at 1119 (citing Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90) (emphasis added). Additionally, \n23                                                                        \n    \u201cproper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency\u2019s deadlines and other critical \n24                                                                        \n    procedural rules.\u201d Woodford, 548 U.S. at 90. Here, it appears Scott failed to follow all \n25                                                                        \n    required steps to allow prison officials to reach the merits of the issue as he failed to file \n26                                                                        \n    any grievance past the informal level related to the claims in this case as required \n27                                                                        \n    pursuant to AR 740. Accordingly, the Court finds Scott failed to exhaust his administrative \n1   remedies pursuant to AR 740 prior to initiating this action. As such, Defendants have met \n2   their burden to establish Scott failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in his case. \n3        The burden now shifts to Scott \u201cto come forward with evidence showing that there \n4   is  something  in  his  particular  case  that  made  the  existing  and  generally  available \n5   administrative remedies effectively unavailable to him.\u201d Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172 (citing \n6   Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 778 n. 5 (9th Cir. 1996)). However, because \n7   Scott did not oppose Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, he provides no evidence \n8   to  show  that  administrative  remedies  were  unavailable  to  him.  As  stated  above, \n9   Grievance No. 2006-31-46153 was resubmitted multiple times but never raised beyond \n10   the informal level. (ECF No. 24-3 at 50.) Scott does not demonstrate a genuine dispute \n11   of material as to whether he properly raised his grievance to the First and Second Level \n12   and exhausted the available administrative remedies by failing to prosecute this case and \n13   oppose Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. See Albino, 747 F.3d at 1172. \n14        Because Scott presents no evidence that administrative remedies were effectively \n15   \u201cunavailable,\u201d  the  Court  concludes  Scott  failed  to  exhaust  available  administrative \n16   remedies prior to filling this action. Accordingly, the Court recommends Defendants\u2019 \n17   motion for summary judgment be granted.2                             \n18   IV.

GARNETT, United States District Judge: \n     Plaintiff Clint Arthur, an individual entrepreneur who offers consulting services on how \nto land television appearances, brought this action against Defendants Orchestrate Business LLC \nand Raffi Andonian, seeking lost revenue, damages, and injunctive relief.  Arthur primarily \nalleges that Defendants misappropriated Arthur\u2019s proprietary business information in order to \nsolicit his customers to pay for similar services offered by Defendants.  Defendants moved to \ndismiss the First Amended Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim \nunder Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  For the reasons \nstated herein, the Court GRANTS the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. \n                  FACTS & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND! \n     Plaintiff Clint Arthur coaches businesses and individuals on securing television \nappearances and leveraging those appearances into business opportunities.  Dkt. No. 12 (\u201cFirst \n\n     ' These facts are drawn from the First Amended Complaint, materials appended to the First \nAmended Complaint, and materials submitted by the parties in connection with Defendants\u2019 motion to \ndismiss. \n     The Court shall refer to the parties\u2019 memoranda of law in support of and opposition to \nDefendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as follows:  Dkt.

Among other things, Arthur offers seminars where \nattendees learn \u201cconfidential secrets and best practices,\u201d including his \u201cMathematical Formula \nfor Getting on TV,\u201d which draws on Arthur\u2019s own experience in the television industry.  See id. \n9 14-15 & Ex. A (\u201cArthur Decl.\u201d) \u00a7 10. \n      Defendant Raffi Andonian, a citizen of Missouri, is the sole partner and owner of \nDefendant Orchestrate Business LLC (\u201cOrchestrate Business\u201d), an LLC organized under the \nlaws of Missouri with a principal place of business in Saint Louis, Missouri, which offers similar \nconsulting services to those offered by Plaintiff.  See FAC \u25a1 7-8, 13.  From August 2020 \nthrough October 2023, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Acapulco, Mexico, Andonian attended four \nseminars hosted by Arthur, over the course of which Andonian and Arthur developed a \nprofessional relationship.  See id. \u00a7 18; Arthur Decl. {J 4, 6.  At each seminar, Andonian signed \nan agreement (the \u201cSeminar Agreement\u201d), under which Andonian agreed not to use resources \nprovided or concepts taught at the seminar to \u201ccompete\u201d with Arthur or his business.  See FAC \n  16-17, 20; Arthur Decl.   75.  At some point after attending these seminars, Andonian asked \nArthur for permission to use information taught by Arthur to launch his own business.  See FAC \n\u00a7 21; Arthur Decl. \u00a7 7.  Although Arthur denied Andonian\u2019s request, Andonian still allegedly \nused the information he learned from Arthur in seminars offered by Orchestrate Business.  See \nFAC \u25a1 22-24. \n      Defendants\u2019 website, www.tvseminar.tv, advertises a syllabus for a training program, \nwhich Arthur alleges borrows heavily from or outright copies the techniques Arthur has \ndeveloped over the years to train his clients for television appearances.  See id. { 24; Arthur Decl. \n 8-11; see also FAC Ex. B  (screenshots of Defendants\u2019 website).  Interested clients may sign \nup for seminars offered by Defendants using the \u201cRSVP\u201d button on the website.  See FAC Ex. B.\n\nDefendant Andonian also manages a personal social media account, which he uses to post, \namong other things, advertisements that appear to be related to Orchestrate Business.  See Opp. \n    Az \n      Arthur alleges that several prospective clients have been solicited by Defendants\u2014 \nspecifically, Arthur alleges that Andonian has reached out to Arthur\u2019s prospective clients and \nencouraged them to purchase seminars offered by Orchestrate Business instead of Arthur\u2019s \nseminars.  See FAC \u00a7\u00a7 25\u201426; Arthur Decl. ff 12-16.  One such client was William Belfar, who \npreviously attended several of Arthur\u2019s seminars and attended weekly private coaching sessions \nwith Arthur.  Supp. Opp. Ex. B. (\u201cBelfar Decl.\u201d) 9 4\u20146.  Belfar is a New York citizen, who \npurchased and attended a seminar offered by Andonian in St. Louis, Missouri on April 26\u201428, \n2024.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1-3.  Since attending Andonian\u2019s seminar, Belfar has not attended any other \nseminars offered by Arthur.  Jd. JJ 13-14. \n      On April 19, 2024, Arthur filed the Complaint in this action, asserting state law causes of \naction, including breach of contract, tortious interference with a business relationship, and unfair \ncompetition.  See Dkt. No. 1.  On April 23, 2024, the Court ordered Arthur to file an amended \ncomplaint in order to correct the Complaint\u2019s deficient allegations regarding complete diversity \nof citizenship.  See Dkt. No. 9.  On May 17, 2024, Arthur filed the First Amended Complaint. \nOn June 21, 2024, Defendants moved to dismiss the First Amended Complaint for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) and failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Dkt. \nNo. 24.  Several months after Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss was fully briefed, on September 17, \n2024, Arthur simultaneously filed a supplemental memorandum of law and other materials in \nfurther opposition to the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, and moved for leave \nto file such materials.  See Dkt. No. 31-1 & Supp. Opp.\n\n                                DISCUSSION \n      Defendants argue that the First Amended Complaint should be dismissed because \n(1) Arthur has failed to establish that this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over \nDefendants; and (2) Arthur has failed to sufficiently plead any of his claims for various reasons, \nincluding because the restrictive covenant in the Seminar Agreement is categorically \nunenforceable and facially invalid.  Defendants also argue that the Court should deny any request \nto further amend the First Amended Complaint because such an amendment would be futile. \n      The Court starts, as it must, with personal jurisdiction.  See Romero v. 88 Acres Foods, \nInc., 580 F. Supp. 3d 9, 14 (S.D.N.Y. 2022); N. Fork Partners Inv. Holdings, LLC v. Bracken, \nNo. 20-CV-02444 (LJL), 2020 WL 6899486, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. 2020).  Because the Court does not \nhave personal jurisdiction over Defendants, there is no need to reach Defendants\u2019 other stated \ngrounds for dismissal. \nL     MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL OPPOSITION \n      As a threshold matter, Arthur\u2019s motion for leave to file his supplemental opposition to the \nmotion to dismiss is granted, and the Court will consider both Arthur\u2019s supplemental opposition \nand the materials appended thereto. \n      \u201cSupplemental filings on motions fully submitted require leave of court.\u201d AA Med. P.C. \nv. Almansoori, No. 20-CV-03852 (DG) (JMW), 2023 WL 4073772, at *2 (E.D.N-Y. June 19, \n2023) (citing Ruggiero v. Warner-Lambert Co., 424 F.3d 249, 252 (2d Cir. 2005)).

Feb. 16, 2019).  \u201cMoreover, a district court is encouraged to give a plaintiff \u2018ample \nopportunity to secure and present evidence relevant to the existence of jurisdiction where\n\nnecessary.\u201d\u201d Jd. (quoting Katz v. Donna Karan Co., L.L.C., 872 F.3d 114, 121 (2d Cir. 2017)); \nsee also APWU v.

A \u201cdistrict court retains considerable latitude in \ndevising the procedures it will follow to ferret out the facts pertinent to jurisdiction.\u201d APWU, \n343 F.3d at 627 (internal marks omitted) (quoting Phoenix Consulting, Inc. v. Republic of \nAngola, 216 F.3d 36, 40 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).  \u201cCases in which courts have authorized parties to \nsupplement the record . . . have generally involved parties who have come to the court with \nactual supplemental information in hand.\u201d Karz v. Metropolitan Trans. Auth., No. 17-CV-00472 \n(KAM), 2017 WL 6734185, at *12 (E.D.N-Y. Dec. 29, 2017). \n      Here, Arthur\u2019s supplemental opposition and supporting materials solely relate to Belfar\u2019s \npurported transactions with Defendants\u2019 business, which are relevant to the disputed \njurisdictional facts in this action, were disclosed during the course of discovery, and were \nunknown to Arthur at the time of the filing of his original opposition.  See Supp. Opp. at 1. \nAccordingly, absent any showing of prejudice or bad faith, and given that Defendants have not \nopposed Arthur\u2019s request, the Court has considered the additional materials submitted by Arthur \nin assessing whether Arthur has sufficiently alleged personal jurisdiction over Defendants. \nII.

Legal Standard \n      \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing that the \nCourt has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\u201d Kamal v.

App\u2019x 4, 5 (2d Cir. 2012)).  \u201cTo make a prima facie showing of personal \njurisdiction, a plaintiff \u2018must include an averment of facts that, if credited by the ultimate trier of \nfact, would suffice to establish jurisdiction over the defendant.\u2019\u201d Jd. (quoting Dorchester Fin. \nSec., Inc. v. Banco BRJ, S.A., 722 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir. 2013)). \n      In assessing whether a plaintiff has made a sufficient prima facie showing, the Court \nmust \u201cconstrue the pleadings and any supporting materials in the light most favorable\u201d to the \nplaintiff, Licci ex rel. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, SAL, 732 F.3d 161, 167 (2d Cir. 2013), \nand resolve all doubts in his favor, V&A Collection, LLC v. Guzzini Props. Ltd., 46 F Ath 127, \n131 (2d Cir. 2022).  The Court may consider materials outside the pleadings when making this \nassessment.  See Am. Girl, LLC v. Zembrka, 118 F Ath 271, 276 (2d Cir. 2024).  However, the \nCourt cannot \u201cdraw argumentative inferences in the plaintiff's favor\u201d and need not accept \nconclusory legal statements.  O'Neil] v. Asat Trust Reg., 714 F.3d 659, 673 (2d Cir. 2013). \n      There are three traditional bases for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant. \nFirst, a court may exercise general jurisdiction over a defendant that is \u201cessentially at home in \nthe forum State.\u201d Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 119 (2014).  Second, a court may \nexercise \u201cspecific or conduct-linked jurisdiction\u201d where there is a sufficient link between the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct in the forum and the conduct at issue in the case.  Sonera Holding B.V. v. \nCukurova Holding A.S., 750 F.3d 221, 225 (2d Cir. 2014).  Third, a defendant can consent to the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction.  Rabinowitz v. Kelman, 75 F Ath 73, 83 (2d Cir. 2023): D.H. \nBlair & Co. v. Gottdiener, 462 F.3d 95, 103 (2d Cir. 2006).  In all cases, the exercise of personal \njurisdiction must comport with fundamental notions of due process.  See Daimler, 571 U.S. at\n\n      Here, Defendants have not consented to the exercise of personal jurisdiction, so the Court \nmust analyze whether Arthur has sufficiently established that the Court has either general or \nspecific personal jurisdiction over Defendants.  To determine whether the Court has general or \nspecific personal jurisdiction over Defendants, \u201c[i]n the absence of a federal statute specifically \ndirecting otherwise, . . . [the Court] look[s] to the law of the forum state to determine whether a \nfederal district court has personal jurisdiction,\u201d which, here, is New York law.  See Brown v. \nLockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 624 (2d Cir. 2016). \n      B.     Discussion \n      Even considering Arthur\u2019s supplemental submission, Arthur has not made a  sufficient \nprima facie showing that Defendants are subject to either general or specific personal jurisdiction \nin New York. \n            i;     Arthur Fails to Establish General Jurisdiction \n      General personal jurisdiction subjects a defendant to suit on all claims.  See Daimler, 571 \nU.S. at 127.  In New York, courts exercise general jurisdiction pursuant to New York Civil \nPractice Law and Rules (\u201cCPLR\u201d) \u00a7 301.  \u201c[OJ]nly a  limited set of affiliations with a forum will \nrender a defendant amenable to [general] jurisdiction there.\u201d Daimler, 571 U.S. at 137.  Fora \nforeign corporate entity, the entity must be \u201cengaged in such a continuous and systematic course \nof \u2018doing business\u2019 [in New York] as to warrant a finding of its \u2018presence\u2019 in this jurisdiction.\u201d \nTrisura Ins. Co. v. Bighorn Constr. and Reclamation, LLC, No. 23-CV-11053 (GHW), 2025 WL \n1531676, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 28, 2025) (quoting McGowan v. Smith, 52 N.Y.2d 268, 272 \n(1981)).  Courts have exercised general personal jurisdiction over a limited liability company \nwhere the company has been organized under the laws of the forum state or maintains its \nprincipal place of business in the forum state.  See, e.g., McLaughlin v. Onanfe Mgmt. Solutions \nLLC, No. 22-CV-06792 (PKC) (MMH), 2024 WL 4184485, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 2024); cf \n\nTrisura Ins. Co., 2025 WL 1531676, at *6 (declining to exercise general jurisdiction over a \nTexas LLC where the company did not conduct any operations, engage in any marketing \nactivities, or maintain any real property or accounts in New York, and none of its members, \nofficers, directors, or employees were in New York).  A corporate entity\u2019s domiciles are the \n\u201cparadigm bases\u201d for a forum\u2019s authority over a non-resident entity, and a corporate entity can \nonly become subject to the personal jurisdiction of an additional forum if the entity\u2019s contacts \nwith the forum state are \u201cso continuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home.\u201d See \nDaimler, 571 U.S. at 138-39 & n.19 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Goodyear \nDunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011)).  \u201cFor an individual, the \nparadigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual\u2019s domicile.\u201d  Goodyear, \n564 U.S. at 924. \n      Here, neither defendant is domiciled in New York for purposes of general personal \njurisdiction.  Arthur affirmatively alleges that both Defendants are citizens of Missouri, and the \nonly asserted basis for personal jurisdiction over Defendants is under CPLR \u00a7  302, not \u00a7 301. \nSee FAC 4 6-8.  Moreover, for the reasons discussed infra, Arthur has not sufficiently shown \nthat this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d in which Orchestrate Business\u2019 contacts with New York are \u201cso \ncontinuous and systematic as to render [it] essentially at home\u201d in this jurisdiction.  See Daimler, \n571 US. at 139 n.19.  Accordingly, the Court finds that it cannot exercise general personal \njurisdiction over Defendants. \n            Ds     Arthur Fails to Establish Specific Jurisdiction \n      Even where general jurisdiction is lacking, a court may have specific jurisdiction \u201cover a \ndefendant in a suit arising out of or related to the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d Jn re \nPlatinum and Palladium Antitr. Litig., 61  F 4th 242, 269 (2d Cir. 2023).  Under CPLR \u00a7 302(a), \nNew York\u2019s long-arm statute, a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary\n\ndefendant where the claim asserted against the defendant arises out of particular acts, including \n(1) transacting business within New York or contracting anywhere to supply goods or services in \nNew York; (2) committing a tortious act in New York; or (3) committing a tortious act without \nthe state, which causes injury to a person or property in New York.  See CPLR \u00a7 302(a): \nForstech Tech. Nigeria Ltd. v. Shell Petroleum Dev. Co. of Nigeria Ltd. (SPDC), No. 24-CV- \n07629 (PAE), 2025 WL 1435203, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2025); Kamal, 2025 WL 919505, at \n\n      The totality of the circumstances and the quality of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the \nforum are both relevant to establishing specific personal jurisdiction.  Forstech Tech. Nigeria \nLtd., 2025 WL 1435203, at *4.  The inquiry \u201cfocuses on the relationship among the defendant, \nthe forum, and the litigation.\u201d  Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284 (2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted) (quoting Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 775 (1984)).  \u201c[T]he \nrelationship must arise out of contacts that the defendant himself creates with the forum State. . . . \n[The Supreme Court has] consistently rejected attempts to satisfy the defendant-focused \nminimum contacts inquiry by demonstrating contacts between . . . third parties[] and the forum \nState.\u201d Jd. (emphasis in original) (internal references omitted). \n      Here, in the First Amended Complaint, Arthur alleges that Defendants \u201cdo substantial \nbusiness in the State of New York and committed the unlawful acts giving rise to this claim \nwithin the State of New York.\u201d  FAC 4 11.  In his oppositions to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, \nArthur argues that Defendants have both transacted business and committed a tortious act against \nhim in New York to sufficiently establish personal jurisdiction, and there is \u201ca reasonable \nprobability that [their] website has been used to affect commercial transactions with customers in \nNew York\u201d sufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts inquiry.  See Opp. at 19-21; Supp. Opp. at\n\n2.  While the Court must construe the allegations in the First Amended Complaint in the light \nmost favorable to Arthur, even under this lenient standard Arthur has not made a prima facie \nshowing that Defendants purposefully transacted business or committed a tortious act in New \nYork. \n                  i.      Defendants Did Not Transact Business in New York \n      With respect to a defendant\u2019s business transactions in New York, \u201c[CPLR \u00a7] 302 is a \nsingle act statute and proof of one transaction in New York is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction, \neven though the defendant never enters New York, so long as the defendant\u2019s activities here \nwere purposeful and there is a substantial relationship between the transaction at the claim \nasserted.\u201d Am. Girl,  118 F.4th at 276 (internal references omitted) (quoting Chloe v. Queen Bee \nof Beverly Hills, LLC, 616 F.3d 158, 170 (2d Cir. 2010)).  \u201cThe quality of a defendant\u2019s New \nYork contacts is the \u2018primary consideration\u2019 in deciding whether the defendant transacted \nbusiness in New York.\u201d  Green Earth Enter., LLC v. Sana Benefits, Inc., No. 24-CV-01852 \n(MMG), 2025 WL 1425325, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 16, 2025) (quoting Fischbarg v. Doucet, 9 \nN.Y.3d 375, 380 (2007)). \n      A defendant may, \u201cthrough [a] website, \u2018purposefully avail[] himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within New York, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u2019\u201d \nBest Van Lines, Inc. v.  Walker, 490 F.3d 239, 242 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting CutCo Indus. v. \nNaughton, 806 F.2d 361, 365 (2d Cir. 1986)).  Whether a defendant\u2019s website transacts business \nin New York depends on the website\u2019s \u201cdegree of interactivity.\u201d  Sanchez v. NutCo, Inc., No. 20- \nCV-10107 (JPO), 2022 WL 846896, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2022); see also Best Van Lines, \nInc., 490 F.3d at 252.  On a \u201csliding scale of interactivity,\u201d courts determine whether the internet \nactivity at issue occurred on a \u201cpassive\u201d website, which \u201cmerely ma[d]e information available to \ninterested visitors,\u201d or an \u201cinteractive\u201d website, \u201cthrough which a defendant clearly \u2018does \n                                      10 \n\nbusiness over the internet.\u2019\u201d  Creative Photographers, Inc. v. Grupo Televisa, S.A.B., 763 F. \nSupp. 3d 618, 633 (S.D.N.Y. 2025).  \u201cFully interactive websites, which are used to purposefully \nsell goods or services in New York . . . can be sufficient to trigger jurisdiction under \u00a7 302(a)(1) \nwhere the cause of action arises out of such purposeful activity.\u201d Jd. (internal references \nomitted).  However, a highly interactive website alone is insufficient to support the exercise of \nspecific personal jurisdiction\u2014in order to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction, a \ndefendant must have used the website to purposely avail itself of the forum state.  Romero v. 88 \nAcres Foods, Inc., 580 F. Supp. 3d 9, 15 (S.D.N-Y. 2022). \n      Here, Arthur has failed to sufficiently allege or show that Defendants have purposefully \ntransacted or solicited business within New York.  Neither Defendants\u2019 website nor the various \nsocial media posts depicting Defendants in connection with New York-related landmarks and \nNew York Life Insurance, individually or in the aggregate, are sufficient to support the exercise \nof specific personal jurisdiction. \n      With respect to the website, Arthur argues that Defendants\u2019 website was \u201cavailable to \nthose residing within ..  . New York,\u201d and potential customers could seek Defendants\u2019 services \nby selecting the \u201cRSVP\u201d button on the website and inputting user-specific information, and \nthereafter, receive an invoice for Defendants\u2019 services.  See Opp. at 20-21.  To start, counsel\u2019s \nunsworn and unsubstantiated statements in Arthur\u2019s opposition are not cognizable evidence for \npurposes of establishing whether this Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants.  Kulhawik \nv. Holder, 571 F.3d 296, 298 (2d Cir. 2009) (\u201cAn attorney\u2019s unsworn statements in a brief are \nnot evidence.\u201d).\u201d \n\n      ? Defendants argue that counsel\u2019s assertions about how potential customers sought out \nDefendants\u2019 services using their website are \u201cspeculati[ve],\u201d\u201d Reply at 10, but fail to specifically rebut or \ncontrovert counsel\u2019s representations with specific averments or evidence refuting jurisdiction. \n                                      11 \n\n      Even taking as true the representations in Arthur\u2019s opposition regarding Defendants\u2019 \nwebsite, Arthur has not sufficiently shown that Defendants purposefully solicited New York \ncustomers through their website or actually transmitted their services to New York.  On its face, \nDefendants\u2019 website does appear interactive and commercial in nature, given that the website \nfeatures Defendants\u2019 paid services and encourages interested consumers to \u201cRSVP.\u201d  Cf \nA.W.LJI. Grp, Inc. v. Amber Freight Shipping Lines, 828 F. Supp. 2d 557, 568-69 (E.D.N_Y. \n2011) (finding the defendant\u2019s website was passive where customers could not transact for the \ndefendant\u2019s services and the defendant did not purposefully solicit New York customers and its \nwebsite was not in any way targeted towards New York).  However, the interactive or \ncommercial nature of Defendants\u2019 website or the availability of Defendants\u2019 website to users in \nNew York is, by itself, insufficient to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction, given that \nArthur has not shown that Defendants in fact used their website to purposefully avail themselves \nof the privilege of conducting activities within New York.  See Romero, 580 F. Supp. 3d at 15; \nCreative Photographers, Inc., 763 F. Supp. 3d at 633 (\u201c[T]he mere availability of [a] [web]site to \nusers in New York, standing alone, does not amount to transacting business in the state for \npurposes of [CPLR \u00a7] 302(a).\u201d). \n      While Defendants need not have offered their seminars in New York or have been \nphysically present in New York to transact business here within the meaning of \u00a7 302(a)(1), in \norder to trigger this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction, Defendants must have engaged in \u201cpurposeful \nactivities\u201d or \u201cvolitional acts\u201d through which they \u201cavailed [themselves] of the privilege of \nconducting activities\u201d within New York, \u201cthus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d \nChloe, 616 F.3d at 169 (internal references omitted): see also Fischbarg, 9  N.Y .3d  at 380 (\u201cNot \nall purposeful activity, however, constitutes a transaction of business within the meaning of \n\n                                      12 \n\nCPLR 302(a)(1).\u201d) (collecting cases).  Nothing in the First Amended Complaint or anything \nsubmitted by Arthur in connection with his opposition sufficiently alleges or shows that \nDefendants purposefully conducted business activity in New York using their website.  Belfar\u2019s \ndeclaration does not suggest that his purchase of Defendants\u2019 services was caused by or in any \nway connected to any efforts by Defendants, through the use of their website or other means, to \ntarget or solicit Belfar or New York customers generally.  Cf Chloe, 616 F.3d at 166 (finding \nsufficient record evidence that the defendant operated a website to offer products for sale to New \nYork consumers, permitted consumers to purchase such products, and facilitated the shipment of \nproducts into New York). \n      In their responses to interrogatories, Defendants represent that no sales are transacted \nthrough websites under their control.  See Postolski Decl. Ex. A.  Similarly, in his Declaration, \nBelfar does not represent that he used Defendants\u2019 website to purchase access to the April 2024 \nseminar\u2014which was held in Missouri, not New York\u2014or when or how he completed his \npurchase.*  Belfar simply states that he \u201cpaid [$3,300] to attend Raffi Andonian\u2019s [TV Seminar] \nin St. Louis, Missouri on April 26, 27, and 28, 2024,\u201d and that he had to travel from his home in \nNew York to do so.  Belfar Decl. 4] 2\u20143.  Although Arthur asserts that Defendants offer other \n\n      3 Personal jurisdiction must be ascertained as of the date this action was commenced. See Prince \ny. Intercept, 634 F. Supp. 3d 114, 128 (S.D.N-Y. 2022) (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction is determined at the time \nof service of the summons and complaint.\u201d); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d \n560, 569-70 (2d Cir. 1996) (\u201cIn general jurisdiction cases, district courts should examine a defendant\u2019s \ncontacts with the forum state over a period that is reasonable under the circumstances\u2014up to and \nincluding the date the suit was filed\u2014to assess whether they satisfy the \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 \nstandard.\u201d) (internal footnote omitted).  Here, Arthur filed this action on April 19, 2024, see Dkt. No. 1, \nand Defendants sent waivers of service on April 22, 2024, see Dkt. Nos. 10 & 11.  Because Belfar does \nnot specify when he purchased access to the April 2024 seminar, which began on April 26, 2024, it is \npossible that, even assuming his transaction would otherwise sufficiently trigger personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants, his purchase occurred after this action was filed and the summons and Complaint were \nserved on Defendants, and therefore would not be a transaction sufficient to invoke this Court\u2019s personal \njurisdiction over Defendants. \n                                      13 \n\nservices on their website, such as daily \u201coffice hours\u201d or opportunities to consult by phone or e- \nmail, see Arthur Decl. Ex. B, there is no evidence that Belfar or any other New York resident \nused these services or that Defendants made any effort to solicit or target New York residents for \nthese services.  While \u00a7 302 is a \u201csingle act statute\u201d and \u201cproof of one transaction in New York \n[can be] sufficient to invoke jurisdiction,\u201d Am. Girl, 118 F.4th at 276 (internal references \nomitted), even viewing Belfar\u2019s Declaration in the light most favorable to Arthur, the nature of \nBelfar\u2019s transaction is an insufficient prima facie showing that Defendants purposefully \ntransacted business in New York.  See Green Earth Enter., LLC, 2025 WL 1425325, at *2: see, \ne.g., Royalty Network Inc. v. Dishant.com, LLC, 638 F. Supp. 2d 410, 421-22 (S.D.N-Y. 2009) \n(finding the defendants\u2019 sales to New York companies were insufficient to invoke personal \njurisdiction where the defendant solicited national corporate customers and did not specifically \ntarget New York audiences or users). \n      Moreover, Arthur has not sufficiently shown that there is \u201can articulable nexus, or a \nsubstantial relationship, between the claim|s] asserted and the action that occurred in New \nYork.\u201d  See Thackurdeen v. Duke Univ., 130 F. Supp. 3d 792, 802 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Best \nVan Lines, 490 F.3d at 246).  The fact that Defendants\u2019 website could have been used by a New \nYork resident, like Belfar, to access Defendants\u2019 services is incidental to the gravity and core \nelements of Arthur\u2019s breach of contract and other state law claims, which appear to lie in \nMissouri (where Defendants\u2019 held the April 2024 seminar and other events) or elsewhere (like \nNevada or Mexico, where Arthur held the seminars that Andonian attended).  See, e.g., id. \n(\u201c[T]he fact that contracts signed in New York served as \u2018a link in the chain of causation leading \nto plaintiff's claims\u2019 is not itself sufficient for purposes of section 302(a)(1).\u201d) (quoting Faherty \nv. Fender, 572 F. Supp. 142, 147 (S.D.N-Y. 1983)); Fischbarg, 9 N.Y.3d at 380 (\u201c[W]e have \n\n                                      14 \n\nheld that \u2018merely telephon[ing] a single order\u2019 to New York requesting a shipment of goods to \nanother state . . . do[es] not support CPLR 302(a)(1) jurisdiction.\u201d) (citing Parke-Bernet \nGalleries v.   Franklyn, 26  N.Y .2d  13, 17 (1970)). \n     Similarly, the various social media posts depicting Defendants in connection with New \nYork-related landmarks and New York Life Insurance do not demonstrate that Defendants were \npurposefully selling their services in New York.  See Opp. Ex. A; see also Postolski Decl. Ex. A \n(Andonian indicating that Arthur coordinated the NASDAQ billboard feature of Defendants\u2019 \nbusiness in Times Square).  To the extent these posts constitute advertisements for Defendants\u2019 \nservices, \u201c[a|dvertisements are [only] sufficient to show that the defendant conduct|ed] business \nin the forum state \u20181f the advertisements are supplemented by business transactions occurring in \nthe state .. . or [are] accompanied by a fair measure of the defendant\u2019s permanence and \ncontinuity in New York which establishes a New York presence.\u2019\u201d A/l-Ahmed v.

Sept. 30, \n2009)).  In light of the limited nature and quality of Belfar\u2019s single transaction to attend \nDefendants\u2019 seminar in Missouri, as described above, Defendants\u2019 social media posts, either \nindividually or together with the representations in the Belfar Declaration and First Amended \nComplaint, do not support a prima facie showing that Defendants had a sufficiently fair measure \nof permanence and continuity in New York to trigger this Court\u2019s personal jurisdiction.  See, \ne.g.,  \u25a1\u25a1 \u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 Grp., Inc., 828 F.

Moreover,\n\nArthur has, again, not even attempted to articulate any nexus or substantial relationship between \nthe social media posts and the claims asserted in the First Amended Complaint. \n      Accordingly, Arthur has not sufficiently demonstrated that Defendants transacted \nbusiness in New York to subject them to this Court\u2019s specific personal jurisdiction. \n                 ii.

This \nprovision \u201creaches only tortious acts performed by a defendant who was physically present in \nNew York when he performed the wrongful act.\u201d Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d \n25, 28 (2d Cir. 1997). \n      In his opposition, Arthur argues that \u201cDefendants have both transacted within the state \nand committed a tortious act against [him] within the State of New York[,]\u201d but fails to articulate \nhow Defendants committed any purported tortious act in New York.  See Opp. at 19.  In the First \nAmended Complaint, Arthur alleges no facts that support a finding that a tortious act was \ncommitted in New York, see FAC \u00a7 11\u2014as discussed above, Andonian attended Arthur\u2019s \nseminars and signed the Seminar Agreement in Nevada and Mexico, and Andonian\u2019s own \nseminars were hosted in Missouri.  Andonian taking some photographs in New York that were \nlater used in social media posts advertising his business does not qualify as a \u201ctortious act\u201d \nsufficient to fall within Section 302(a)(2), and Arthur does not articulate any basis on which it \ncould. \n      Accordingly, Arthur has not demonstrated that Defendants committed a tort in New York \nsufficient to invoke this Court\u2019s specific personal jurisdiction.* \n\n      * Under CPLR \u00a7 302(a)(3), a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary who \n\u201ccommits a tortious act without the state causing injury to [a] person . . . within the state[.]\u201d  CPLR \u00a7 \n                                      16 \n\n                            *      *      *      * \n     Because the Court concludes that it lacks a lawful basis to exercise personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants, the Court need not consider any of the other grounds raised by Defendants for \ndismissal of this action.  See, e.g., Creative Photographers, Inc., 763 F. Supp. 3d at 630; Marcus \nv. Archer, No. 19-CV-07099 (JPO), 2020 WL 4937353, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2020). \n     Furthermore, the Court denies Arthur leave to amend because repleading in this District \ncannot cure this substantive jurisdictional defect, and thus, any amendment would be futile.  See, \ne.g., Smith v. United States, 554 F. App\u2019x 30, 32 (2d. Cir. 2013); Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d \n99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201c\u2018[A] futile request to replead should be denied.\u201d).  Nothing in this \nOpinion bars Arthur from re-filing his claims in a court that can exercise personal jurisdiction \nover Defendants, if he chooses. \n                               CONCLUSION \n     For the foregoing reasons, the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) is GRANTED.  The \nClerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate Dkt. No. 24 and CLOSE this case. \n\nDated: August 1, 2025 \n    New York, New York \n                                            SO ORDERED. \n\n                                               United States District Judge \n\n302(a)(3).  Here, Arthur does not assert or argue that Defendants committed a tortious act outside of New \nYork, which caused him injury within New York. Accordingly, the Court does not analyze or determine \nwhether Defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction under \u00a7 302(a)(3).  See United States v. Lawrence, \n553 F. Supp. 3d 131, 134.1 (S.D.N-Y. 2021) (\u201cCourts need not entertain an argument that was not \nme    (internal references omitted); Hudson v. Cnty. of Dutchess, 51 F.

For Plaintiffs Lara Vera, Jemirria Thompson, and Bryant \nPreudhomme (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), the answer is yes:  Plaintiffs bring this proposed \nclass action against Defendant Prime Hydration LLC (\u201cDefendant\u201d) asserting \nviolations of various state consumer fraud statutes (collectively, the \u201cState \nConsumer Fraud Acts\u201d); violations of New York General Business Law (\u201cGBL\u201d) \n\u00a7\u00a7 349-350; and common-law claims for breach of express warranty, unjust  \nenrichment, and fraud.  Broadly, Plaintiffs claim that Defendant\u2019s energy \ndrinks (the \u201cProducts\u201d) contain 15-25 milligrams more caffeine than the 200 \nmilligrams represented by Defendant on its labels and in its advertising, and, \nfurther, that this difference in caffeine content amounts to deceptive    \nadvertising and consumer fraud.                                           \n    Before the Court is Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Consolidated \nClass Action Complaint (the \u201cCAC\u201d) for failure to state a claim pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and failure to plead with particularity \nunder Rule 9(b) where applicable.  Additionally, Defendant asserts that   \nPlaintiffs lack standing to pursue their injunctive relief claims.  Accordingly, \nDefendant requests the Court dismiss the CAC with prejudice.  For the reasons \nset forth in the remainder of this Opinion, the Court grants Defendant\u2019s motion \nto dismiss in full.                                                       \n                         BACKGROUND1                                     \n\nA.   Factual Background                                                   \n    Plaintiffs are citizens and residents of New York.  (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 5-7).    \nDefendant \u201cformulates, manufactures, advertises, and sells\u201d the Products, as \nwell as non-caffeinated hydration drinks, throughout the country, including in \nNew York.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 12).  The label on the back of each of the Products has \nthe following language: \u201cCONTAINS: 200mg OF CAFFEINE PER 12 OZ            \nSERVING[.]\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 20).  Likewise, on the side of the Products\u2019 packaging, there \nis an icon of a lightning bolt with the language: \u201c200mg CAFFEINE[.]\u201d  (Id.).  \nDefendant also advertises the caffeine content as such on its website and \n\n\u201cthrough third-party retail[e]r websites like Amazon.com.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 19).   \n    Plaintiff Vera received a case of the Products in or around August 2022, \nwhich she believes was part of a promotion.  (CAC \u00b6 5).  Subsequently, Plaintiff \nVera purchased the Products \u201cseveral times in 2023\u201d and \u201cpaid approximately \n\n\n1    This Opinion draws its facts from the Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the \u201cCAC\u201d \n    (Dkt. #33)), the well-pleaded allegations of which are taken as true for purposes of this \n    Opinion.  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The Court also relies, as \n    appropriate, on the exhibit attached to the Declaration of Stephen Saxl (Dkt. #41-1 \n    (\u201cSaxl Decl., Ex. 1\u201d)), a copy of a pre-suit notice letter sent on behalf of Plaintiff Lara \n    Vera.                                                                \n    For ease of reference, the Court refers to Defendant\u2019s memorandum of law in support of \n    its motion to dismiss as \u201cDef. Br.\u201d (Dkt. #42); to Plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum of law in \n    opposition to the motion to dismiss as \u201cPl. Opp.\u201d (Dkt. #43); and to Defendant\u2019s reply \n    memorandum of law in further support of the motion to dismiss as \u201cDef. Reply\u201d (Dkt. \n    #44).                                                                \n$3.00 or $4.00 for each.\u201d  (Id.).  Plaintiff Thompson purchased the Products \n\u201cseveral times in 2023.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 6).  Plaintiff Thompson also purchased two 24-\ncount cases of the Products on April 14, 2024, paying \u201capproximately $1.45\u201d \n\nfor each can.  (Id.).  Plaintiff Preudhomme purchased the Products \u201c[d]uring the \napplicable statute of limitations period\u201d for \u201cup to the regular retail price.\u201d  (Id. \n\u00b6 7).                                                                     \n    In making their respective purchasing decisions, Plaintiffs claim that \nthey relied on Defendant\u2019s label and representation that the Products contained \n200 milligrams of caffeine.  (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 5-7).  However, Plaintiffs aver that \u201cbased \nupon testing commissioned by Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, the Products actually \ncontain between 215-225 milligrams of caffeine rather than the advertised 200 \n\nmilligrams.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 21).  Plaintiffs allege that they \u201ceither paid a price premium\u201d \nfor the Products or \u201cwould not have purchased the Products at all\u201d had they \nknown the label \u201cwas false and misleading.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; see also id. \u00b6 7 \n(\u201cPlaintiff ... was unaware that the Products contained more caffeine than \nadvertised and would not have purchased the Products if that were fully   \ndisclosed or would have paid less than he did.\u201d)).  Plaintiff Preudhomme further \nclaims that he would purchase the Products in the future \u201cif Defendant    \n(i) lowered the amount of caffeine in the Products; and/or (ii) undertook \n\ncorrective changes to the packaging.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 7).                         \nB.   Procedural Background                                                \n    This litigation commenced on September 29, 2023, when Plaintiff Kyra \nDrugas filed a class action complaint substantially similar to the operative \nCAC, on behalf of the same putative class.  (See 23 Civ. 8552 (the \u201cDrugas \nAction\u201d), Dkt. #1).2  On November 16, 2023, Defendant notified this Court of its \nintent to file a motion to dismiss and requested a pre-motion conference.  (Id., \n\nDkt. #13).  The Court held a pre-motion conference on January 10, 2024, at \nwhich the Court set a briefing schedule.  (Id., January 10, 2024 Minute Entry).  \nOn the day that Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was due, Plaintiff Drugas filed a \nnotice of voluntary dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil           \nProcedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i).  (Id., Dkt. #18).3                              \n    Approximately two months later, on April 8, 2024, Plaintiff Vera filed her \ninitial class action complaint (the \u201cVera Action\u201d) against Defendant on behalf of \nthe putative class.  (Dkt. #1).  Shortly thereafter, on April 25, 2024, Defendant \n\nmoved to transfer the Vera Action to this Court, claiming that the Drugas \nAction was \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the Vera Action.  (Dkt. #8 at 1).  The case was \npromptly transferred to the undersigned.  (Dkt. #9).  At that time, Defendant \nrequested that Plaintiff Vera dismiss the action, \u201cpointing out that Vera\u2019s only \nalleged purchases \u2014 in June and August of 2022 \u2014 were false as Prime Energy \nwas not available for purchase until 2023.\u201d  (Dkt. #14 at 1).  Instead of \ndismissing the action, Vera filed an amended class action complaint on May 7, \n\n\n2    The class action complaint included an additional cause of action under the Magnuson-\n    Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301, that is not included in the CAC.  (See 23 Civ. \n    8552 (the \u201cDrugas Action\u201d), Dkt. #1 at 16-17).                       \n3    Two days prior to Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss deadline in the Drugas Action, Ms. \n    Drugas\u2019s counsel notified Defendant of their desire to move for an order substituting \n    Plaintiff Vera as named plaintiff, as Ms. Drugas no longer wished to be a named \n    plaintiff.  (Dkt. #8 at 1-2).  Defendant declined to consent; Ms. Drugas moved for a \n    voluntary dismissal instead.  (Id.).                                 \n2024.  (Dkt. #12 (the \u201cVera FAC\u201d)).  In relevant part, Vera amended her claim to \naver that she had received a case of the Products in or around August 2022, \n\u201cwhich she believes was through a promotion,\u201d and then subsequently       \n\npurchased the Products \u201cseveral times in 2023.\u201d  (Vera FAC \u00b6 5).  The Vera \nFAC also added Plaintiff Thompson\u2019s claims.  (Id. \u00b6 6).                   \n    On May 20, 2024, Defendant sought the Court\u2019s permission to file a   \nmotion to dismiss the Vera FAC.  (Dkt. #14).  Defendant cited the Court\u2019s \nprevious permission in the Drugas Action to \u201cmove to dismiss a virtually  \nidentical complaint\u201d as obviating the need for a pre-motion conference.  (Id. at \n1).  \u201cIn view of the unique circumstances of this case,\u201d the Court agreed, \npermitted the parties to proceed to motion practice without a pre-motion  \n\nconference, and set a briefing schedule.  (Dkt. #17).  In accordance with the \nbriefing schedule, Defendant filed its motion to dismiss on June 21, 2024.  \n(Dkt. #19-21).                                                            \n    As briefing began in the Vera Action, Plaintiff Bryant Preudhomme filed a \nseparate complaint against Defendant on May 9, 2024 (24 Civ. 3568 (the    \n\u201cPreudhomme Action\u201d), Dkt. #1), which complaint was \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to \nthe Vera FAC (id., Dkt. #12 at 1).  On June 14, 2024, Defendant filed a letter \nmotion requesting to transfer the Preudhomme Action to this Court, in view of \n\nthe fact that the Vera Action was already proceeding before the undersigned.  \n(Id.).                                                                    \n    On June 24, 2024, this Court denied without prejudice to renew       \nDefendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and instead consolidated the Vera Action with \nthe Preudhomme Action into the current form of the action, In Re: Prime Energy \nConsumer Litigation.  (Dkt. #22).  On October 2, 2024, the Court held a   \nconference regarding the appointment of interim lead counsel; the Court   \n\nsubsequently granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to appoint Kristen Lake Cardoso as \ninterim lead counsel.  (October 2, 2024 Minute Entry).4                   \n    Shortly before that conference, on September 17, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the \nCAC, the operative pleading in this action.  (Dkt. #33).  In accordance with the \nbriefing schedule set forth at the October 2 conference, Defendant filed its \nmotion to dismiss the CAC on October 16, 2024.  (Dkt. #40-42).  Plaintiffs filed \ntheir opposition to Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on November 18, 2024.  (Dkt. \n#43).  Defendant filed its reply on December 9, 2024, at which point the instant \n\nmotion was fully briefed.  (Dkt. #44).                                    \n                          DISCUSSION                                     \nA.   Applicable Law                                                       \n    When considering a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil     \nProcedure 12(b)(6), a court must \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 \nfavor, assume all well-pleaded factual allegations to be true, and determine \nwhether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d  Faber v. Metro. Life \nIns. Co., 648 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  In doing so, the Court \u201cmay review only a narrow universe of   \nmaterials.\u201d  Goel v. Bunge, Ltd., 820 F.3d 554, 559 (2d Cir. 2016).  This narrow \n\n\n4    Plaintiffs initially moved to appoint interim co-lead counsel, but later withdrew that \n    request.  (Dkt. #25-26, 36-37).                                      \nuniverse includes \u201cfacts stated on the face of the complaint\u201d and \u201cdocuments \nappended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference.\u201d  Id. \n(internal citation omitted); accord United States ex rel. Foreman v. AECOM, 19 \n\nF.4th 85, 106 (2d Cir. 2021).  Thus, in resolving the instant motion, the Court \nmainly considers the CAC.  However, as appropriate, the Court also considers \nthe pre-suit notice letter submitted as an exhibit to Defendant\u2019s motion to \ndismiss, which is incorporated in the CAC by reference.  (CAC \u00b6 70 (\u201cOn March \n4, 2024, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sent Defendant a pre-suit notice letter, via certified \nmail return receipt requested, that complied in all respects with U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2-\n313, 2-607.\u201d); Saxl Decl., Ex. 1).                                        \n    To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \u201csufficient \n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on \nits face.\u2019\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)); see also In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., 502 \nF.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir. 2007) (\u201cWhile Twombly does not require heightened fact \npleading of specifics, it does require enough facts to nudge plaintiff\u2019s claims \nacross the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570)).  This requires \u201cmore than labels \nand conclusions\u201d but not \u201cdetailed factual allegations.\u201d  Twombly, 550 U.S. at \n\n555.                                                                      \n    \u201cWhere a complaint pleads facts that are \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a  \ndefendant\u2019s liability, it \u2018stops short of the line between possibility and \nplausibility of entitlement to relief.\u2019\u201d  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, \n550 U.S. at 557).  Moreover, \u201cthe tenet that a court must accept as true all of \nthe allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.  \nThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere \n\nconclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d  Id.  Therefore, \u201ca court considering a \nmotion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because \nthey are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of  \ntruth.\u201d  Id. at 679.                                                      \nB.

Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., 98 N.Y.2d 314, 324 n.1 (2002).  As such, the Court \nmerges its analysis of the two claims.  See Cosgrove v. Oregon Chai, Inc., 520 F. \n\nSupp. 3d 562, 575 (S.D.N.Y. 2021).  To sufficiently plead a claim under either \n\u00a7 349 or \u00a7 350, \u201ca plaintiff must allege [i] that the defendant ... engaged in \nconsumer-oriented conduct; [ii] that the conduct was materially misleading; \nand [iii] that the plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the allegedly deceptive \nact or practice.\u201d  Id. (quoting Weisblum v. Prophase Labs, Inc., 88 F. Supp. 3d \n283, 292 (S.D.N.Y. 2015)) (alterations in Cosgrove).  Plaintiffs are not required \nto meet the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil     \nProcedure 9(b) for GBL claims.  Id.  Still, \u201cplaintiffs must do more than \n\nplausibly allege that a \u2018label might conceivably be misunderstood by some few \nconsumers\u2019\u201d; they must \u201cplausibly allege \u2018that a significant portion of the \ngeneral consuming public or of targeted customers, acting reasonably in the \ncircumstances, could be misled.\u2019\u201d  Sarr v. BEF Foods, Inc., No. 18 Civ. 6409 \n(ARR) (RLM), 2020 WL 729883, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 13, 2020) (quoting Jessani \n\nv. Monini N. Am., Inc., No. 17-2504-cv, 2018 WL 6287994, at *1 (2d Cir.

Plaintiffs Fail to Allege Materially Misleading Conduct    \n              Because They Have Not Sufficiently Alleged That Any        \n              Misrepresentation Occurred                                 \n    The crux of Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC is the sole allegation that, \u201cbased upon testing \ncommissioned by Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, the Products actually contain between \n215-225 milligrams of caffeine rather than the advertised 200 milligrams.\u201d  \n(CAC \u00b6 21).  Defendant argues that this allegation \u2014 with no information  \nregarding \u201chow many cans of the [Products] were tested, when they were    \nmanufactured, when and where they were purchased, and how the cans were   \nselected for testing\u201d \u2014 is insufficient to permit the Court \u201cto make any  \ninferences regarding the caffeine content\u201d of the Products Plaintiffs allegedly \npurchased.  (Def. Br. 11).  The Court agrees.                             \n    In Hawkins v. Coca-Cola Company, a sister court in this District     \nconfronted a similar issue.  654 F. Supp. 3d 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2023).  There, the \nplaintiff alleged that the defendant had engaged in materially misleading \n\nconduct because the product in question was labeled \u201c100% natural flavors,\u201d \nbut, according to the plaintiff, \u201c[l]aboratory analysis concluded th[e p]roduct \ncontain[ed] artificial, DL-Malic Acid instead of natural, L-Malic Acid.\u201d  Id. at \n296-97.  The court found that the \u201camorphous laboratory analysis\u201d was \u201ca far \ncry from raising any factually substantiated allegations that the [p]roduct \ncontain[ed] artificial malic acid, rather than natural malic acid.\u201d  Id. at 306 \n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Therefore, the court concluded that \u201cthe \n[c]omplaint\u2019s allegations that the [p]roduct contain[ed] artificial flavors [were] \nconclusory statements that the Court [wa]s not required to accept.\u201d  Id.  \n    Courts in this District have also addressed this issue in various cases \nchallenging food manufacturers\u2019 use of the terms \u201cvanilla\u201d and \u201cnatural   \nflavors,\u201d inter alia, in their descriptions or advertising.  See, e.g., Myers v. \nWakefern Food Corp., No. 20 Civ. 8470 (NSR), 2022 WL 603000 (S.D.N.Y.     \nMar. 1, 2022) (dismissing the amended complaint); Santiful v. Wegmans Food \n\nMkts., Inc., No. 20 Civ. 2933 (NSR), 2022 WL 268955 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2022) \n(\u201cSantiful I\u201d) (dismissing the first amended complaint); Santiful v.

Supp. 3d at 303 (collecting cases).  As relevant here, in \nSantiful II, the court offered the following observations in dismissing the \nplaintiffs\u2019 claims under GBL \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350 for the second time:          \n         To substantiate their allegations, [p]laintiffs included        \n         the  results  of  a  laboratory  analysis,  which  were         \n         interpreted solely by their attorneys, with no support          \n         from,  or  even  identification  of,  the  researcher  who      \n         conducted the analysis, or of any other expert[.]  As           \n         clearly stated in the [c]ourt\u2019s [f]irst [o]pinion & [o]rder,    \n         [p]laintiffs\u2019  failure  to  include  \u201cinformation  as  to  the  \n         testing  methodology,  the  date,  time,  or  place  of  the    \n         testing, who conducted the testing, and what the exact          \n         product  tested  was\u201d  is  \u201cinsufficient  to  support           \n         [p]laintiffs\u2019 otherwise conclusory statements as to the         \n         ingredients of the [p]roduct.\u201d \u2026 Despite this [c]ourt\u2019s         \n         clear  guidance  in  the  [f]irst  [o]pinion  &  [o]rder,       \n         [p]laintiffs failed to provide this information regarding       \n         the details of their laboratory analysis.  Because the          \n         presence of ethyl vanillin is supported solely by the           \n         results of an unsubstantiated laboratory analysis, this         \n         [c]ourt  sees  no  \u201cnon-conclusory,  substantiated              \n         allegations\u201d to suggest ethyl vanillin is present in the        \n         [p]roduct[.]                                                    \n\n2023 WL 2457801, at *4 (internal citations omitted); see also Myers, 2022 WL \n603000, at *4 (\u201cTo begin, [p]laintiff claims that the [p]roduct was allegedly \nsubjected to a laboratory test, but she fails to provide any details whatsoever \nabout [what] this laboratory test entailed.  She does not, for instance, describe \nthe testing methodology followed, the specific date, time, or place of the testing, \nwho conducted the testing, the qualifications of the testers, etc.\u201d).     \n    The same holds true here.  Plaintiffs have failed to provide any     \nsupporting information whatsoever regarding the alleged testing, other than \nthat it was \u201ccommissioned by Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u201d and allegedly showed that \nthe Products contain 215-225 milligrams of caffeine.  (CAC \u00b6 21).  As this is a \nmere conclusion, it is \u201cnot entitled to the assumption of truth.\u201d  Iqbal, 556 U.S. \nat 679; see also Hawkins, 654 F. Supp. 3d at 306 (finding that plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations based on an \u201camorphous laboratory analysis\u201d were \u201cconclusory  \nstatements that the [c]ourt [wa]s not required to accept\u201d); Santiful II, 2023 WL \n2457801, at *4 (finding \u201cresults of an unsubstantiated laboratory analysis\u201d to \nbe neither non-conclusory nor substantiated allegations).  Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 \nentire case is premised on the conclusory statement that the Products actually \ncontain 215-225 milligrams of caffeine, as purportedly determined by      \nunspecified testing.  Without any factual allegations as to the true caffeine \ncontent of the Products, or the testing that led to that conclusion, Plaintiffs do \n\nnot \u201cnudge\u201d their \u201cclaims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d  In re \nElevator Antitrust Litig., 502 F.3d at 50 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n    Plaintiffs contend that the so-called \u201cVanilla Cases,\u201d including Santiful I \nand Myers, are inapposite to the instant case.  (Pl. Opp. 5-6).  In particular, \nPlaintiffs argue that those cases were dismissed on the ground that the results \nof the alleged laboratory testing did not support the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and not \nbecause the information regarding the laboratory testing itself was inadequate.  \n(Id.).  Not so.  While it is true that those cases found that the respective \n\nplaintiffs had also failed to demonstrate how the laboratory testing results \nsupported their ultimate conclusions \u2014 for example, that artificial flavors were \npresent where the defendants had represented that the flavors were natural \u2014 \nPlaintiffs ignore their first steps.  See Myers, 2022 WL 603000 at *4     \n(concluding that plaintiff had failed to sufficiently allege misrepresentation \nwhere she \u201cfail[ed] to provide any details whatsoever about [what] this   \nlaboratory test entailed,\u201d and \u201c[f]urther, \u2026 failed to substantiate how exactly \nthe two alleged findings from the purported lab test helped her arrive at the \n\nconclusion that the [p]roduct is made of artificial flavors\u201d); Santiful I, 2022 WL \n268955, at *4 (first finding that plaintiff\u2019s proffered lab analysis \u201ccontain[ed] no \ninformation as to the testing methodology, the date, time, or place of the \ntesting, who conducted the testing, and what the exact product tested was,\u201d \nand then finding that \u201ceven the data offered\u201d did not \u201cconclusively support\u201d the \nallegations).  That the courts in those cases found the testing allegations to be \ninsufficient on two bases does not undermine this Court\u2019s conclusion that \n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege any information about their proffered laboratory \ntesting renders those allegations \u201cinsufficient to support Plaintiffs\u2019 otherwise \nconclusory statements as to the [contents] of the Product.\u201d  Santiful II, 2023 WL \n2457801, at *4 (quoting Santiful I, 2022 WL 268955, at *4 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)).                                                          \n    Finally, Plaintiffs rely on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in John v. Whole \nFoods Market Group, Inc. to support their contention that it is \u201cwell-settled law \nthat Plaintiffs are not required to disclose all the details of their testing at the \n\npleading stage.\u201d  (Pl. Opp. 6 (citing John v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc., 858 \nF.3d 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2017))).  While that general proposition of law may be \ntrue, it does not mean that Plaintiffs are not required to disclose any details of \ntheir testing at this stage.  In John, the plaintiff relied on, and attached to the \ncomplaint, a press release from the New York City Department of Consumer  \nAffairs (the \u201cDCA\u201d) announcing a preliminary finding that Whole Foods\u2019 New \nYork City locations had systematically overcharged customers for pre-packaged \nfoods by overstating the weights of the products.  John, 858 F.3d at 734.  The \n\npress release, however, explicitly provided that the \u201cDCA tested packages of 80 \ndifferent types of pre-packaged products and found all of the products had \npackages with mislabeled weights.  Additionally, 89 percent of the packages \ntested did not meet the federal standard for the maximum amount that an   \nindividual package can deviate from the actual weight[.]\u201d  Id.  That is more \ninformation than Plaintiffs have provided here.  In the instant case, Plaintiffs \nhave provided no information as to the number of cans tested, whether various \n\nflavors were tested, whether various lots were tested, and, importantly, how \nmany cans tested actually contained more than 200 milligrams of caffeine.  In \naddressing the district court\u2019s concerns about the lack of information regarding \nthe testing methodology, the Second Circuit in John explained that \u201c[a]t the \npleading stage, [a plaintiff] need not prove the accuracy of [its] findings or the \nrigor of its methodology; he need only generally allege facts that, accepted as \ntrue, make his alleged injury plausible.\u201d  Id. at 737.  Here, the Court has not \nasked Plaintiffs to support the accuracy of their allegations or their rigor of \n\ntheir methodology, but to simply provide some non-conclusory factual      \nallegations as to the alleged testing.  Plaintiffs have now failed to do so three \ntimes in this action.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded \nmaterially misleading conduct, and their claims under GBL \u00a7\u00a7 349 and 350  \nfail.                                                                     \n         b.   Plaintiffs Also Fail to Allege Materially Misleading       \n              Conduct Because the Purported Misrepresentation Is Not     \n              Material as a Matter of Law                                \n    As discussed, \u201c[t]o establish that conduct is materially misleading, a \nplaintiff must demonstrate that a reasonable consumer would likely be misled \nby the alleged misrepresentation.\u201d  Lugones v. Pete & Gerry\u2019s Organic, LLC, 440 \nF. Supp. 3d 226, 240-41 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (quoting Sitt v. Nature\u2019s Bounty, Inc., \nNo. 15 Civ. 4199 (MKB), 2016 WL 5372794, at *8 (E.D.N.Y.

The Court     \nunderstands from the CAC that consumers of the Products are generally     \nseeking more caffeine, not less, as evidenced by their desire to purchase the \nProduct in the first place (in comparison to, for example, purchasing a cup of \n\ncoffee or a can of Red Bull, each with about half the caffeine content).  (CAC \n\u00b6 14).  Such consumers decide to purchase the Products, which are labeled as \nan \u201cenergy drink\u201d and contain a depiction of a lightning bolt next to the caffeine \ncontent, because they want a substantial amount of caffeine.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 20).  \nTherefore, it defies common sense to suggest that it would be material that the \nProducts contain a mere 7-11% additional caffeine \u2014 the exact thing those \nconsumers are seeking.                                                    \n    In determining whether a defendant\u2019s action or practice is materially \n\nmisleading, the Second Circuit considers whether it \u201cwould have caused [the \nplaintiffs] to make a different initial choice[.]\u201d  McCracken, 91 F.4th at 607 \n(citing N. State Autobahn, Inc. v. Progressive Ins. Grp. Co., 953 N.Y.S.2d 96, 102 \n(2d Dep\u2019t 2012) (holding that consumer-oriented conduct is materially     \nmisleading only \u201cwhere the deception pertains to an issue that may bear on a \nconsumer\u2019s decision to participate in a particular transaction\u201d)).  In the instant \ncase, Plaintiffs claim that they would not have purchased the Products had \n\nthey known that the caffeine content representation \u201cwas false and        \nmisleading.\u201d  (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 5-6).  But, the Court reiterates, Plaintiffs must \u201cplausibly \nallege that a significant portion of the general consuming public or targeted \ncustomers, acting reasonably in the circumstances, could be misled,\u201d Twohig, \n519 F. Supp. 3d at 160 (quoting Sarr, 2020 WL 729883, at *3 (internal     \nquotation marks omitted)), not just that Plaintiffs themselves were misled.  \nThey have not done so here.  Plaintiffs\u2019 only allegation on the point is to assert \nthat is \u201cit is axiomatic that the amount of reported caffeine contained within \n\nDefendant\u2019s Products \u2026 is material to any consumer seeking to purchase an \nenergy drink, particularly where there is the possibility of an adverse reaction \nto caffeine, such as with children.\u201d  (CAC \u00b6 18).5  However, it is inconceivable to \nthis Court that a consumer singularly focused on purchasing a beverage with a \nsignificantly-above-average concentration of caffeine would be concerned, \nmuch less disturbed, by the inclusion of a tiny bit more caffeine in that \nbeverage.                                                                 \n\n\n\n5    Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the negative side effects of caffeine on children is simply \n    a red herring.  The Court notes that none of the Plaintiffs is a child, nor do the Plaintiffs \n    put forth any allegations that children consumed the Products and experienced such \n    side effects.  Moreover, Plaintiffs aver there is \u201cno proven safe dose of caffeine for \n    children\u201d (CAC \u00b6 15), and the Products themselves contain a warning that they are \u201cnot \n    recommended for children\u201d (id. \u00b6 20).  Thus, the Court fails to see how 15-25 \n    milligrams, in addition to the already considerable 200 milligrams, would be material \n    when no amount is alleged to be safe for children, or why that is relevant to this action.  \n    Additionally, Plaintiff Preudhomme asserts that he would purchase the \nProducts again if Defendant reduced the amount of caffeine in the Products or \nchanged the label.  (CAC \u00b6 7).  Assuming arguendo that the Products do    \n\ncontain 215 milligrams of caffeine, and that the label were changed to reflect \nthat fact, Plaintiff Preudhomme would purchase the Products again.  This  \nsuggests to the Court that the alleged 7-11% difference in caffeine content is \nnot in fact material to him.  For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes \nthat even if Plaintiffs had adequately alleged a misrepresentation, they  \nnonetheless fail to allege that a reasonable consumer would be materially \nmisled due to Defendant\u2019s practices.6                                     \n\n\n\n\n6    Because Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged materially misleading conduct, the Court \n    need not reach the injury requirement for the GBL claims.  But the Court notes that, at \n    first blush, it would appear to beggar logic that a person who purchases an energy \n    drink would be injured by receiving slightly more caffeine through such purchase.  \n    Indeed, under Small, it would seem that Plaintiffs have not presented a legally \n    cognizable injury.  See Small v. Lorillard Tobacco Co., 94 N.Y.2d 43, 56 (1999) (holding \n    that \u201ccustomers who buy a product that they would not have purchased, absent a \n    manufacturer\u2019s deceptive commercial practices,\u201d have not suffered an injury under \n    General Business Law \u00a7 349).  As just discussed, Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded \n    a deceptive practice.  But even if they had, as to injury, they have alleged only that they \n    either paid a price premium for the Products or would not have purchased the products \n    if they had known that they included slightly more caffeine than publicized on the label.  \n    (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 5-7).                                                        \n    This Court is aware of another decision in which the Second Circuit suggested that to \n    sufficiently plead an injury, plaintiffs must allege that because of a misleading practice, \n    they purchased a product and did not receive the full value of their purchase.  Orlander \n    v. Staples, Inc., 802 F.3d 289, 302 (2d Cir. 2015).  Again, this Court fails to see how \n    Plaintiffs here did not receive the full value of their purchase.  But it notes that sister \n    courts in this District have interpreted Orlander to mean that plaintiffs can sufficiently \n    plead an injury by alleging that they \u201cwould not have purchased the product or been \n    willing to pay as much had they known the true facts.\u201d  See Valcarcel v. Ahold U.S.A., \n    Inc., 577 F. Supp. 3d 268, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (quoting Campbell v. Whole Foods Mkt. \n    Grp., Inc., 516 F. Supp. 3d 370, 388 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (internal quotation marks \n    omitted)).  The Court struggles to reconcile these cases with the holding in Small. \n    2.   Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Violation of the State     \n         Consumer Fraud Acts                                             \n    To review, Plaintiffs also bring a cause of action for violation of several \nState Consumer Fraud Acts.  (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 39-44).  In particular, Plaintiffs bring \nthis claim individually and on behalf of a putative \u201cConsumer Fraud Multi-\nState Class\u201d consisting of \u201c[a]ll persons in the states of California, Florida, \nIllinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, \nand Washington that purchased the Products within the applicable limitations \nperiod\u201d (id. \u00b6 29), alleging that Defendant\u2019s deceptive practices violate the \n\nconsumer fraud acts in each of the states listed above (id. \u00b6 41).        \n    The parties agree that these multi-state claims \u201crise and fall\u201d with \nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims under GBL \u00a7\u00a7 349-350.  (See Def. Br. 18-20; Pl. Opp. 13-14 \n(arguing that this Court should follow a sister court, which found that the \nplaintiff in that case had stated a GBL claim, and therefore had stated multi-\nstate claims as well (citing Kelly v. Beliv LLC, 640 F. Supp. 3d 286, 300 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2022))).  The Court agrees with the parties that the multi-state claims \n\nhere rise and fall with the GBL claims, and accordingly dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaims for violation of state consumer fraud acts.  See Adeghe v. Procter & \nGamble Co., No. 22 Civ. 10025 (CS), 2024 WL 22061, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2, \n2024) (\u201c[C]onsumer protection statutes from states across the country share \nthe common requirement that a reasonable consumer would be misled by a    \ndefendant\u2019s statement \u2026, and because this Court has already determined that \nthe Product\u2019s labeling would not mislead a reasonable consumer, [her]     \nconsumer fraud multi-state class claims [must be] dismissed.\u201d (internal   \nquotation marks and citations omitted) (alterations in original)).        \n    3.   The Court Dismisses Plaintiffs\u2019 Remaining Claims                \n    Plaintiffs also bring claims for breach of express warranty (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 62-\n\n70), unjust enrichment (id. \u00b6\u00b6 71-75), and fraud (id. \u00b6\u00b6 76-81).  As other courts \nresolving similar claims have observed, the failure of Plaintiffs\u2019 overarching \ntheory of materially misleading business practices dooms these claims as well.   \nSee, e.g., Barreto v. Westbrae Nat., Inc., 518 F. Supp. 3d 795, 806-10 (S.D.N.Y. \n2021) (dismissing claims for fraud, breach of warranty, and unjust enrichment \non the basis that the court had \u201calready determined that [plaintiff] has failed to \nallege that the product\u2019s labeling would be likely to deceive or mislead a \nreasonable consumer\u201d); Wynn, 2021 WL 168541, at *6-7 (same).              \n\n           a.   Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Breach of Express   \n                Warranty                                                 \n    \u201cNew York breach of express warranty claims require [i] a material   \nstatement amounting to a warranty; (ii) the buyer\u2019s reliance on this warranty as \na basis for the contract with his immediate seller; (iii) the breach of this \nwarranty; and (iv) injury to the buyer caused by the breach.\u201d  Cosgrove, 520 F. \nSupp. 3d at 585 (quoting Brady v. Basic Rsch., L.L.C., 101 F. Supp. 3d 217, \n235 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) (quoting Avola v. La.-Pacific Corp., 991 F. Supp. 2d 381, \n391 (E.D.N.Y. 2013))) (emphases in Avola).  Here, Plaintiffs have failed to allege \nthat the Products do not actually comport with the specified caffeine content on \nthe label by providing no non-conclusory allegations regarding the actual \ncaffeine content of the Products.  Thus, they have failed to allege a breach of \nwarranty.                                                                 \n    Additionally, a breach of express warranty claim requires that \u201ca buyer ... \n\nprovide the seller with timely notice of the alleged breach of warranty.\u201d  Quinn \nv. Walgreen Co., 958 F. Supp. 2d 533, 544 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing N.Y. U.C.C. \n\u00a7 2-607(3)(a)).  Plaintiffs assert that a pre-suit notice letter was provided by \ntheir counsel to Defendant on March 4, 2024, that \u201ccomplied in all respects \nwith U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2-313, 2-607.\u201d  (CAC \u00b6 70; see also Saxl Decl., Ex. 1).    \nDefendant contests the adequacy of the March 4, 2024 pre-suit letter on the \nbasis that it only identified the transactions that Plaintiff Vera originally \nalleged \u2014 purchases she purportedly made in June and August of 2022, \u201cat a \n\ntime when Prime Energy drinks were not yet on the market,\u201d and which      \nPlaintiff Vera now concedes she received through a promotion.  (Def. Br. 21; \nsee also Saxl Decl., Ex. 1 at 4).  Thus, Defendant claims that Plaintiffs failed to \nprovide pre-suit notice that identifies a \u201ctroublesome\u201d transaction.  (Def. \nBr. 20).  See Anderson v. Unilever United States, Inc., 607 F. Supp. 3d 441, 457 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2022) (\u201cTo satisfy this notice requirement, a plaintiff must \u2018alert [the] \ndefendant that the transaction was troublesome[.]\u2019\u201d (quoting Grossman v.  \nSimply Nourish Pet Food Co., 516 F. Supp. 3d 261, 282 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 27,  \n\n2021)) (alteration in original)).  However, Plaintiffs assert that a pre-suit letter \nneed not \u201cspecify when a product was purchased or used.\u201d  (Pl. Opp. 16    \n(quoting Maroney v. Woodstream Corp., 695 F. Supp. 3d 448, 467-68 (S.D.N.Y. \n2023))).                                                                  \n    \u201cAlthough [t]he sufficiency and timeliness of the notice is generally a \nquestion for the jury, to adequately plead the pre-suit notice requirement, \nplaintiff[s] must provide factual allegations \u2014 such as the date and method \n\nplaintiff[s] sent a pre-suit notice \u2014 supporting the contention that [they] \nnotified [the] defendant of the alleged breach within a reasonable time.\u201d  \nHawkins, 654 F. Supp. 3d at 307 (internal quotation marks and citations   \nomitted) (alterations in original).  Plaintiffs have done so here; in consequence, \nif Plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded a claim for breach of warranty, the Court \nmight also have found that Plaintiffs had sufficiently pleaded, at the motion to \ndismiss stage, the pre-suit notice requirement as well.  However, the Court \nnotes that Plaintiffs\u2019 original allegations about Vera\u2019s June and August 2022 \n\npurchases, which are demonstrably false, raise concerns about the verity of \ntheir other allegations.  In any event, and for all of the reasons stated \npreviously, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for breach of express warranty. \n           b.   Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Unjust Enrichment   \n    Next, Plaintiffs allege a claim for unjust enrichment.  A claim for unjust \nenrichment under New York law requires a plaintiff to allege that \u201c[i] defendant \nwas enriched, [ii] at plaintiff\u2019s expense, and [iii] equity and good conscience \nmilitate against permitting defendant to retain what plaintiff is seeking to \nrecover[.]\u201d  Diesel Props S.r.l. v. Greystone Bus. Credit II LLC, 631 F.3d 42, 55 \n\n(2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment \nclaim is premised on the same theory of misrepresentation the Court has   \nalready rejected as inadequately pleaded.  \u201cWhere a deceptive trade practices \nclaim fails for failure to allege deception, an unjust enrichment claim fails, too.\u201d  \nCosgrove, 520 F. Supp. 3d at 587-88 (quoting Kennedy v. Mondelez Glob. LLC, \nNo. 19 Civ. 302 (ENV) (SJB), 2020 WL 4006197, at *15 (E.D.N.Y. July 10,   \n\n2020)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                                \n    Additionally, Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim must be dismissed as \nduplicative.  \u201c[U]njust enrichment is not a catchall cause of action to be used \nwhen others fail.\u201d  Corsello v. Verizon N.Y., Inc., 18 N.Y.3d 777, 790 (2012).  \nFurthermore, \u201can unjust enrichment claim is not available where it simply \nduplicates, or replaces, a conventional contract or tort claim.\u201d  Shane Campbell \nGallery, Inc. v. Frieze Events, Inc., 441 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (quoting \nCorsello, 18 N.Y.3d 777 at 790).  \u201cIndeed, courts in the Second Circuit have \n\nconsistently held that unjust enrichment claims are duplicative of GBL claims.\u201d  \nBarton v. Pret A Manger (USA) Ltd., 535 F. Supp. 3d 225, 249 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) \n(collecting cases).                                                       \n    Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Defendant was unjustly enriched is premised on the \nsame alleged misrepresentation that the Products contain 200 milligrams of \ncaffeine.  In fact, Plaintiffs rely on precisely the same allegations by  \nincorporation.  (CAC \u00b6 71).  When a claim for unjust enrichment \u201crelies on the \nsame factual allegations and same theory of liability\u201d as Plaintiffs\u2019 other causes \n\nof action, it is \u201cplainly insufficient.\u201d  Hesse v. Godiva Chocolatier, Inc., 463 F. \nSupp. 3d 453, 474 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).  Plaintiffs rejoin that this claim is not \nduplicative because they plead unjust enrichment in the alternative to their \nclaim for breach of express warranty.  (Pl. Opp. 20).  However, courts in this \nCircuit have expressly rejected such an argument.  See Nelson v. MillerCoors, \nLLC, 246 F. Supp. 3d 666, 679 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (holding that while \u201c[i]t is \ncertainly true, as Plaintiff argues, that he may plead unjust enrichment in the \n\nalternative to his other claims[,] ... it is equally true that, even pleaded in the \nalternative, claims for unjust enrichment will not survive a motion to dismiss \nwhere plaintiffs fail to explain how their unjust enrichment claim is not merely \nduplicative of their other causes of action\u201d); see also Campbell, 516 F. Supp. 3d \nat 394 n.15 (\u201cThat [p]laintiff asserts that she brings this claim in the alternative \ndoes not change the analysis.\u201d).  Therefore, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for unjust \nenrichment also fails as it is duplicative of Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims. \n           c.   Plaintiffs Fail to State a Claim for Fraud               \n    Finally, Plaintiffs allege a claim for fraud.  To state a claim for fraud \n\nunder New York law, a plaintiff must allege that (i) the defendant made a \nmisrepresentation or material omission of fact, (ii) that was false and known to \nbe false by the defendant, (iii) made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to \nrely upon it, (iv) the plaintiff\u2019s justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation or \nmaterial omission, and (v) injury.  See Pasternack v. Lab\u2019y Corp. of Am.  \nHoldings, 27 N.Y.3d 817, 827 (2016); see also In re Fyre Festival Litig., 399 F. \nSupp. 3d 203, 212-13 (S.D.N.Y. 2019).  Claims for fraud, even under state law, \nmust also satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).  See \n\nPremium Mortg. Corp. v. Equifax, Inc., 583 F.3d 103, 108 (2d Cir. 2009); see \ngenerally Malvar Egerique v. Chowaiki, No. 19 Civ. 3110 (KPF), 2020 WL    \n1974228, at *24 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2020), vacated in part sub nom. Weiss v. \nDavid Benrimon Fine Art LLC, No. 20-3842-cv, 2021 WL 6128437 (2d Cir.     \nDec. 28, 2021) (summary order).  Here, Plaintiffs fall at the first hurdle: for all \nof the reasons outlined above, Plaintiffs have not alleged an actionable  \n\nmisrepresentation or omission.  Accordingly, the fraud claim is dismissed. \n    4.   Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Pursue Injunctive Relief            \n    Defendant lastly argues that Plaintiffs lack standing under Article III to \nseek injunctive relief because they fail to allege that they intend to purchase \nthe Products in the future.  (Def. Br. 24-25).  Defendant brings this claim \npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  (Id.).  \n\u201cAlthough standing challenges are sometimes brought under Rule 12(b)(6), \u2018the \nproper procedural route is under Rule 12(b)(1).\u2019\u201d  Cosgrove, 520 F. Supp. 3d at \n574 (quoting All. for Env\u2019t Renewal, Inc. v. Pyramid Crossgates Co., 436 F.3d \n\n82, 88 n.6 (2d Cir. 2006)).                                               \n    \u201cTo establish standing to obtain prospective relief, a plaintiff \u2018must show \na likelihood that he will be injured in the future.\u2019\u201d  Carver v. City of New York, \n621 F.3d 221, 228 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Shain v. Ellison, 356 F.3d 211, 215 \n(2d Cir. 2004)).  There must be a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that the future injury will \noccur, or the threatened injury must be \u201ccertainly impending.\u201d  Susan B.  \nAnthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014).  \u201c[A]llegations of possible \nfuture injury are not sufficient,\u201d Clapper v. Amnesty Int\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, \n\n409 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), nor is \u201cpast exposure to illegal \nconduct,\u201d City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 102 (1983) (internal \nbrackets omitted) (quoting O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495 (1974)).  \n\u201cAlthough past injuries may provide a basis for standing to seek money    \ndamages, they do not confer standing to seek injunctive relief unless the \nplaintiff can demonstrate that she is likely to be harmed again in the future in \n\na similar way.\u201d  Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 239 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(citing DeShawn E. ex rel. Charlotte E. v. Safir, 156 F.3d 340, 344-45 (2d Cir. \n1998)).                                                                   \n    Plaintiffs contest this challenge, pointing to Plaintiff Preudhomme\u2019s \nstatement that he \u201cwould purchase the Products again if Defendant (i) lowered \nthe amount of caffeine in the Products; and/or (ii) undertook corrective  \nchanges to the packaging.\u201d  (Pl. Opp. 21 (quoting CAC \u00b6 7)).  However,    \nconditional promises to purchase the Products if they are altered are     \n\ninsufficient to allege future injury.  See Pete & Gerry\u2019s Organic, LLC, 440 F. \nSupp. 3d at 238-39; see also Holve v. McCormick & Co., Inc., 334 F. Supp. 3d \n535, 553 n.10 (W.D.N.Y. 2018) (collecting cases).  Therefore, as there is no \n\u201clikelihood that [Plaintiffs] will be injured in the future,\u201d Carver, 621 F.3d at \n228, Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief.                  \n    5.   The Court Dismisses the CAC With Prejudice                      \n    Given the procedural history in this case, the Court dismisses the CAC \nwith prejudice.  There have been a total of five complaints filed in this litigation, \nwith at least two pre-motion letters and two motions to dismiss informing \n\nPlaintiffs, before the filing of the CAC, of their deficiencies with respect to their \nalleged testing.  Nevertheless, while Plaintiffs amended Plaintiff Vera\u2019s \nallegations to remedy the obvious problem that she claimed to have purchased \nthe Products before they were even on the market, Plaintiffs failed to amend \ntheir testing allegations to include any factual assertions about those tests, \ndespite being on notice of this deficiency from Defendant.  (Dkt. #14 at 2; Dkt. \n\n#21).  Particularly in light of the many other deficiencies identified in this \nOpinion, the Court declines to give Plaintiffs yet another bite at the apple.  Cf. \nNat\u2019l Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, 898 F.3d 243, 257-58 \n(2d Cir. 2018) (\u201cWhen a plaintiff was aware of the deficiencies in his complaint \nwhen he first amended, he clearly has no right to a second amendment even if \nthe proposed second amended complaint in fact cures the defects of the first.  \nSimply put, a busy district court need not allow itself to be imposed upon by \nthe presentation of theories seriatim.\u201d (alteration, footnote, and internal \n\nquotation marks omitted)); see also Cosgrove, 520 F. Supp. 3d at 588      \n(\u201cBecause [p]laintiffs have twice amended their complaint after receiving pre-\nmotion letters from Defendant, and because Plaintiffs\u2019 one-clause request for \nleave to amend in their opposition does not explain how they can cure the \ndeficiencies identified in this [o]pinion, this Court dismisses the SAC with \nprejudice.\u201d (internal citations omitted)).                                \n                         CONCLUSION                                      \n    Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED in full.  The Clerk of Court is \ndirected to terminate all pending motions, adjourn all remaining dates, and \nclose this case.                                                          \n\n    SO ORDERED.                                                          \n\nDated:    July 31, 2025                                                   \n         New York, New York       __________________________________     \n                                      KATHERINE POLK FAILLA              \n                                     United States District Judge"
